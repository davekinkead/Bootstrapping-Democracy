# The Limits of Liberalism

This chapter argues that while we want both liberalism and democracy, the requirements of liberalism are incompatible with democratic processes.  Public reason liberalism offers a possible solution to this dilemma but one that cannot be realised in either the context of fixed political associations or reasonable pluralism.

## Democracy & Liberalism

- democracy and liberalism are different things
- one does not entail the other
- liberalism places limits on the scope of democracy
- liberalism makes democracy more desirable


## A line in the sand

- liberalism limits the scope of democracy
- these limits are contested
- these limit cannot be determined democratically


## Putting liberalism first

- the self-defeating problem can be overcome by prioritising liberalism
- but which liberalism?
- comprehensive liberalisms are also contested
- objective liberalism based on tolerance?
- 'the fact of coercion' 


## A failure of public reason

- public reason offers a plausible solution
- this only works with unanimous agreement
- unanimous agreement is not possible


## A problem without a solution

- we want liberalism to constrain democracy
- these constraints will be contested
- we can't solve this problem democratically
- imposing comprehensive liberalism requires coercion
- public reason liberalism fails in static societies
