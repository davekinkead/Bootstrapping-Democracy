Democracy "refers very generally to a method of group decision making characterized by a kind of equality among the participants at an essential stage of the collective decision making." @christiano2006

  - collective decision making
  - covers many types: families, voluntary organizations, economic firms, as well as states and transnational and global organizations
  - definition has no normative weight: democracy could be bad
  - equality may be formal or subtantive

Christiano lists the following types of justifications:

Instrumental

  - JS Mill claims RD is better in 3 ways: "strategically, epistemically and via the improvement of the characters of democratic citizens"

  - Epistemic (Goodin, 2003, chap. 5; Estlund, 2002, 77-80)
    - FOR
    - CJT with aggregative voting
    - ensures multiple perspectives
    - promotes autonomy, reflective and critical thinking
    - AGAINST
    - decision makers lack expertise (plato)
    - promotes rhetoric & charisma over critical thinking
    - citizens lacks incentives to focus on the common good
    - citizens lack the expertise or are apothetic

  - some reasons for instrumentalism
    - consequentialist moral reasoning
    - no distribution of political power could ever be justified except by reference to the quality of outcomes of the decision making process (Arneson 2002, pp. 96-97).
    - democratic procedures cannot be intrinsically fair (Riker 1980, p. 116): social choice theory

Intrinsic

  - Liberty: liberty requires an equality of power and the only way to do this is with democracy Carol Gould (1988, pp.45-85) 
  - Public Justification: laws and policies are legitimate to the extent that they are publicly justified to the citizens of the community. Joshua Cohen (2002, p. 21)
  - Equality
    - Peter Singer (1973, pp. 30-41) Democracy embodies a kind of peaceful and fair compromise among these conflicting claims to rule 
    - failing to obey the decisions of a democratic assembly amounts to treating one's fellow citizens as inferiors (Christiano 2004, 284-287)
  - Consent
  
  Lit review of normative accounts

  - Condorcet, List and Goodin. 2001: Democracy has value because majority voting tracks the truth under certain conditions.

  - Estund 1997: Democracy has value because it is has a fair procedure and yields the best results.

  - Arneson 2004: Democracy isn't intrinsically just. It has value because it is (contingently and uncertainly) the best system for realising justice.

  - Frey and Stutzer 2005: People value political participation. Democracy has value because it increases utility not just from good policy but also by allowing people to participate.

  - Cohen 2002: Laws and policies are legitimate to the extent that they are publicly justified to the citizens of the community.

  - Singer 1973: Democracy is a peaceful and fair compromise the conflicting desires of everyone's dictatorial rule.

  - Schumpter 1956: Responsible elites competing for the peoples vote is the best way to distribute power in the public interest. 

  - Mill 1861: Democracy has value because it considers everyone's interests, more reliable for making the right decisions, and transforms the moral character of participants.

  - Elster 1986: "The task of politics is not only to eliminate inefficiency [as in markets], but also to create justice--a goal to which the aggregation of political preferences is a quite incongruous means"

  - Sen 1999: Democracy has value because it promotes policies that improve the well being of citizens and allows them to shape the norms and values of that well being.

  - Rousseau: A general will is necessary for legitimate authority. Democracy has value because it discovers the general will in a manor that is equal and universal.

  - Gould 1988: Democracy is valuable because only it can give individuals a chance of self government.

  - Rawls 1971: Justice demands a liberal and egalitarian democracy.

  - Rorty

  - Christiano 2004:

  - Buchanan & Tullock 1965: Elites will expand their power and create inefficient government, so more social functions should be performed by the market.

  - Plato: The people lack the necessary expertise for ruling so elites should rule.

  - will of the people

  - self determination/check on abuse of power  

  - promotes freedom
