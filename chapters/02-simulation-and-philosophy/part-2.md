# Simulating Theory with Literate Programming

- what is it?
  - interweive source code and documentation
  - typical approaches focus on optimising....
  - LP focuses on explaination

- why use it?
  - write in an order that aids explaination rather than compilation
  - programming has 2 audences - compiler and human
  - different tools are optimised for each (code and documentation)
  - LP combines both into a single file 

> Programming is best regarded as the process of creating _works of literature_. (@knuth1992 p ix)

## Replication

## Coffeescript (1000)
