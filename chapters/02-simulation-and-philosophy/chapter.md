# Philosophy & Simulation

- philosophy is hollow without thought experiments
  - because of X
- X also applies in the case of simulation
- therefore philosophy is hollow without simulation

## Philosophy & the Thought Experiement (2500)

Philosophy is hollow without thought experiments

  - Ship of Theseus
  - The Ring of Gyges

  - First Meditations
  - infinite god

  - JJT abortion
  - Searles Chinese Room

What exactly are thought experiements?

  - using the imagination to investigate the nature of things (@SEP)

  "In the view of almost everyone, a thought experiment should give sudden and exhilarating insight." @P&A2003 p306

  > Derek Parfit, has defended their frequent use by stating that thought experiments arouse in us ‘strong beliefs’ (Parfit 1984, 200). (p307)

  - simply examples of conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz, 2006, KIRK LUDWIG 2007).
  - Kuhn 1964 p263 "Thought experiment is one of the essential analytic tools which are deployed during crises and which then help to promote basic conceptual reform"
  - answered solely on the basis of one's grasp of the relevant concepts.
  - usually involves stating a bicondition of necessary and sufficient conditions that satisfy some concept obtaining
  - use Gettier example

  - an experiement done with thought. explaination is necessary
  - isolate features under investigation
  - observe what happens to our intituitons
  - give us 'strong beleifs' (@parfit1984 p200)

  - a species of mental modelling @Nersessian1991 p431

  - provide evidence themselves, putting them on a par with real-world experiments (see Gendler, 2004).
  - "we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking" @SEP
  - or access to instinctive knowledge (@mach1897, Kühne, 2006, pp. 165–202)

  - different types
  - different domains, not just 'science'
  - they can be investigative, refuting, supporting
  - SEP taxonomy

What's the value of TE? How are they used?

  - evoke our intuitions (dennett)
  - cheap and easy way to refute - galileo

  - Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the process of understanding (see Behmel, 2001). 

  - real demonstration isn't possible (why) (see Sorensen, 1992, pp. 200–202).
  - James McAllister has argued that in science thought experiments did not really occur before the time of Galileo (McAllister 1996).
  - They can be reconstructed and replaced by actual experiments later (Norton 1986)

  - they give us a common point around which we can collaborate see @cohntiz2006 p374

> the function of thought experiments in philosophy is to prepare the common ground upon which theories to resolve philosophical puzzles are to be constructed. @cohntiz2006 p389

> Thought experiments constitute the common ground from which we start our philosophical analysis. @cohntiz2006 p389

What are their limitations

  - only as good as their setting assumptions
  
  - replication. 
  - when is a thought experiement a new one?
  - kripke busted for falsifying results of thought experiements
  
  - problems data 
    - intuition are cultural/context dependent

  - Peijnenburg 2003 argues that phil TE's are often contractictory and question begging

## Thought Experiements are simulations (2500)

Modelling vs thought exp vs simulation

- TE are best thought of as a species of mental modelling.  mental simulation is a central aspect of cognition @nersessian1991 p431

## What problems does simulation solve (2500)

argument types in political Philosophy

empiric vs rational

## Literate Programming (1000)

- what is it?
  - interweive source code and documentation
  - typical approaches focus on optimising....
  - LP focuses on explaination

- why use it?
  - write in an order that aids explaination rather than compilation
  - programming has 2 audences - compiler and human
  - different tools are optimised for each (code and documentation)
  - LP combines both into a single file 

> Programming is best regarded as the process of creating _works of literature_. (@knuth1992 p ix)
