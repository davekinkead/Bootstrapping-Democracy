# Philosophy & Simulation

- thought experiments
  - history


> According to Grant (2007, 201), during the late Middle Ages “the imagination became a formidable instrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that would have astonished” ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially Aristotle.




  - how they are used?
    - conceptual analysis see Cohnitz, 2006)
    - clarity abstract ideas (see Behmel, 2001)
    


- simulation
  - what is it?
  - how is it like TE?
  - what problems does simulation solve?

- simulation in academia
  - other fields
  - why not so much in philosophy
  - how simulation can help phil.

- augmented argument
  - literate programming
  - why is this better?
  - augmenting argument

- wrap up.
  - phil without TE is hopeless
  - sim is like TE
  - sim overcomes many epistemic issues
  - augmented argumentation takes things a step further




- philosophy is hollow without thought experiments
  - because of X
- X also applies in the case of simulation
- therefore philosophy is hollow without simulation
- computational approaches have much to offer philosophy because they overcome the epistemic limitations associated with complexity, intractability, and emergence.

- there are distinct epsitemic challenges in political philosophy
  - analytic intractability
  - complexity
  - emergence


- given certain assumptions, calculate the likelihood of particular outcomes.



## Introduction

> "Five years" says the sherif.  "That's what you're looking at. Five years in prison if you say nothing."

> "But if you talk and turn state's evidence, well then, it'll just be a few years probation."

> "Of course, if your accomplice talks first, then the deal's off.  But I'll still recommend early parole if you confess though." he continutes. "I'll let you stew over that awhile."

> It was never your intention to get caught and wind up in a prison cell but that's where you find yourself - in a 3 by 3 metre interrigation room facing a two-way mirror.  Next door, your accomplice is facing the same choice as you: stay quite as planned, withhold the crucial evidence the police lack, and you'll only have to spend a few months in prison. There's just one catch. The sherrif has just offered you a deal to become a rat and implicate your accomplice. If you do, she gets five years and you walk away with a few months probation.  Your problem is that the sherrif is also about to offer the same deal to her.

> Despite the best outcome for you both is to keep your lips closes and hold silent, the deal changes things considerably.  If your accomplice remains quite, you can rat her out and avoid prison - the two of you aren't that close anyway.  If she confesses and you don't then you'll be looking at five years instead of three.  And you know of course, that she knows this too.  So what should you do - make the best choice for both of you and stay silent or the best choice for yourself and confess?  What would a rational person do?

This is a thought experiment - the famous _Prisoner's Dilemma_.  A form of conceptual analysis for illustrating an abstract theory and clarifying the nature of a problem or phenomenon.  Thought experiments have been described as "processes of hypothetical reasoning that proceeds by eliciting the consequences of some projected supposition which, for aught that one actually knows to the contrary, may well be false" (@rescher2005 p3). A peculular cross of experimentation and theorising (@horowitz&massey1991), or simply as "devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things" (@brown1997).  

By framing the issue in narrative form, the thought experiment allows us to .... In this case, to better understand the conflict between individual and group rationality, and the inherent difficulties in motivaing rational and selfish individuals to work towards a common good.

Thought experiments have long been a part of philosophy.  Given there narrative, almost story telling like form that lends itself so well to oral traditions, it is likely that thought experiments actually pre-date written philosophy. According to @rescher2005 p2, pre-socratics "invented thought experimentation as a cognitive procedure and practiced it with great dedication and versatility".  Thales of Miletus (circa 620 BC) offers one of the first documented examples:

> Suppose that a like wood and other similar substances, the Earth floats in a large body of water.


Middle Ages ....


Contemporary example ....

The thought experiments described help us with our philosophical explaination, categorization, communication, and understanding.  This however, sounds a lot like run-of-the-mill conceptual analysis.  Are thought examples anything more this?  The similarities between the two methods are striking.  Conceptual analysis - the answering of questions based solely on one's grasp of the relevant concepts - is an integral part of metaphysics and philosophy (@jackson) and like the thought experiment, has been a tool of the philosopher since pre-Socratic times.  Conceptual analysis and thought experiments are deeply intertwined.  They are, according to @Nimtz2010 p189, "widely acknowledged to be essential to our armchair ways of doing philosophy". 

Conceptual analysis deals in the currency of ideas.  Like thought experiments, conceptual analysis seeks to clarify and simplify abstract and complex ideas, and most importantly, the relation between them or as @jackson p28 describes it, the "entailment theses between matters described in some preferred vocabulary and matters described in other vocabularies".  Importantly, these ideas are can be and often are _a priori_.  Both thought experiments and conceptual analysis begin with suppositions of porported truth.  These desiderata are taken to hold true and through conditional or biconditional inference, some other concept is shown to obtain (or to not).  Recourse to empiric data and _a posteriori_ claims are unnecessary once we accept the premises involved.

@Gettier1963's thought experiments about knowledge provide a good example.  Suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the proposition "Jones owns a Ford".  Her belief in this is justified because last month, she saw him driving one.  Smith has another friend Brown who is currently overseas but where, she does not know.  From the proposition "Jones owns a Ford", Smith can rightfully infer that "Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona".  But unbeknownst to Smith, Jones sold his car last week and Brown just happened to be Barcelona. So Smith has a belief - "Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona", that belief is justified, and that belief is true.  Yet we wouldn't consider this to be a case of knowledge.

According to @chalmers&jackson p6, this is a paradigmatic case of "an a priori argument, in which empirical information played no essential role, and its conclusion ... [an] example of a non-obvious a priori truth".  Gettier's thought experiment is simultaniously conceptual analysis.

But thought experiments are more than _just_ conceptual analysis.  They offer something more. @Peijnenburg&Atkinson2003 p306, for example claim that "in the view of almost everyone, a thought experiment should give sudden and exhilarating insight."  Unlike conceptual analysis in which focus can move back and forth between desiderata and entailment, thought experiments follow a more linear process where "we visualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we let it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally, we draw a conclusion" @brown1997.  

Some philosophers see thought experiments as aids to conceptual analysis. @Cohnitz2006 p389 views thought experiments as constituting "the common ground from which we start our philosophical analysis", while @Kuhn1964 p263 claims that the "thought experiment is one of the essential analytic tools which are deployed during crises and which then help to promote basic conceptual reform".  For @Nimtz2010 p190 however, the reverse is true - conceptual analysis and the tacit semantic knowledge we possess is what "entitles us to hold true the counterfactuals on which philosophical thought experiments pivot".

Another distinguishing and eponymous feature of thought experiments is their experimental nature.  Like scientific experiments, thought experiments allow us to control events, produce observations or intuitions, and confirm or disconfirm rival theories (@Blackburn 1994, p131).  They involve running a instance or model and following a logical or causal path. "Running a mental simulation is required for it to be both thought and experimental" (@Nersessian1991 p431).  Often, thought experiments offer the only alterative to scientific experimentation when physical, technological, ethical, or financial constraints make real ones impossible @Sorensen1992 p200)  In this regard, thought experiments provide evidence themselves which puts them on par with real-world experiments (@gendler2004).  

Unlike their real-world alternatives, thought experiments offer something science cannot - _a priori_ knowledge.  Thought experiments give us access to internal, instinctive knowledge @Kühne2006 p167) which in some domains like ethics, might be all we can hope for.  With them, "we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking" @SEP.  Alternatively, thought experiments act as a heuristic to deepen our understanding what we already know empirically, what @dennett has called _intuition pumps_.  Thought experiments that offer evidence or support for a theory might be called explainatory or _constructive_.

Often however, thought experiments are used destructively.  This is exactly what @jjt p69 does when she asks us to consider the impermissability of abortion: 

> You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? 



Thompson's thought experiment shows us another way that they are used.
  - transfer the principles of one area to another (moral)
    

  - specific function in theory




Not everyone agrees however...What are their limitations

  - only as good as their setting assumptions
  
  - replication. 
  - when is a thought experiement a new one?
  - kripke busted for falsifying results of thought experiements
  
  - problems data 
    - intuition are cultural/context dependent

  - Peijnenburg 2003 argues that phil TE's are often contractictory and question begging



> Derek Parfit, has defended their frequent use by stating that thought experiments arouse in us ‘strong beliefs’ (Parfit 1984, 200). (p307)

  - debate

> The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple: How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?

> Philosophy without thought experiments seems almost hopeless.




Plato's Allegory of the Cave is a famous early example.

Philosophy is hollow without thought experiments

  - Ship of Theseus
  - Allegory of the Cave

  - First Meditations
  - infinite god

  - JJT abortion
  - Searles Chinese Room


  - an experiement done with thought. explaination is necessary
  - isolate features under investigation
  - observe what happens to our intituitons
  - give us 'strong beleifs' (@parfit1984 p200)

  - a species of mental modelling @Nersessian1991 p431


  - different types
  - different domains, not just 'science'
  - they can be investigative, refuting, supporting
  - SEP taxonomy

What's the value of TE? How are they used?

  - evoke our intuitions (dennett)
  - cheap and easy way to refute - galileo

  - Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the process of understanding (see Behmel, 2001). 

  - real demonstration isn't possible (why) (see Sorensen, 1992, pp. 200–202).
  - James McAllister has argued that in science thought experiments did not really occur before the time of Galileo (McAllister 1996).
  - They can be reconstructed and replaced by actual experiments later (Norton 1986)

  - they give us a common point around which we can collaborate see @cohntiz2006 p374

> the function of thought experiments in philosophy is to prepare the common ground upon which theories to resolve philosophical puzzles are to be constructed. @cohntiz2006 p389




Thought Experiments vs Computer Simulations

> the relationship between computer simulation and thought experiments has started to attract attention (see Behmel, 2001, pp. 98–108; Di Paolo et al., 2000; El Skaf and Imbert, 2013; Lenhard 2011; Stäudner, 1998).

> Accordingly, it has been argued that “computational modeling is largely replacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only a limited role in future practice of science, especially in the sciences of complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena” (see Chandrasekharan et al., 2012, p. 239).

> Maybe related to this is the proposal of Schulzke (2014) to think of video games philosophically as executable thought experiments.


- TE are best thought of as a species of mental modelling.  mental simulation is a central aspect of cognition @nersessian1991 p431

Computers are ubiquitous in our lives today.  Computer networks allow us to connect and communicate with billions of people around the planet in milli-seconds.  This connectedness is transforming they way people work - they allowing an increasing number of people to work remotely from a beach in Thailand or a ski slope in Austria.  For others, this connectedness is eroding job security as many functions from accounting to radiology are being outsourced to regions with lower wage costs.  And for many more people, they ..

We are increasingly connecting not just to others but to computers themselves.  Whether its our smart phones becoming an extension of our minds (@chalmers), or Aritifical Intelligence agents becoming our assistants, our advisors, or even our bosses, computers are transforming how we live and work.

Computational approaches to investigation are also becoming far more common place in academia.  Computational Biologists use mathematical models and computer simulation to study behavioural, biological, and social systems.

These examples don't merely involve the use of computers to assist with endeavours like wordprocessesing - computers here are an essential element.

Yet this isn't the case in philosophy. Compare and constrast.  

Why is this so?

This is ashame because computations approaches have much to offer philosophy in general and social philosophy in particular.

Outline the argument.

- monte carlo to estimate probabilities

## What is Simulation?

  - lit review
  - humphreys
  - winsberg
  - hartmann
  - Frigg and Reiss


## A new type of knowledge

  - complexity and analytically intractable problems
    - too many calculations for humans
    - problems without closed form expressions
    - structural equations
  - experiment better by isolating variables and rerunning one-off events
  - emergence and discoverability
    - discovery vs justification

## Limits

  - claims about reality are only as good as a simulations fidelity to reality
  - address the "its not new knowledge" claim

## Simulation is still philosophy

  - philosophy has always done thought experiments - history
  - thought experiments are like simulation
  - so simulation is very much philosophy
