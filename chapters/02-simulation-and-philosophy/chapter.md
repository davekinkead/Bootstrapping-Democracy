# On Method

In which I answer the question - what is the method of philosophy?


- systematic philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, and Hegel.


1. History of method 

## intro 1000

  - thought experiment
  - what is the method of philosophy?
    - Sokolowski
  - "philosophy begins in wonder" soc in http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/theatu.html
  - examining the unexamined life
  - philosophy as leftovers (james shaw)
    - philosophy lacks a particular domain, it is universal
  - unmasking ideologies and assumptions / exploration of ideas
  - Wonderment & intellectual curiosity -> asking why like a 5 year old.
  - objection: philosophy as a kind of writing, routy & Derrida


## Analysis

  Philosophy is almost synonymous with analysis.... breaking things down into their constituent parts, translating language into abstract form, working back to first principles, and reconstituing concepts into a synthesis of new knowledge...

  Analysis can be traced to the very beginning of philosophy.  Euclid's gemotrey, Aristotles' Analytics, Plato's JTB ...

  Here we can distinguish three distinct flavours of analysis - decompositional, regressive, and transformative ...

  Decompositional ...

  Regressive ... (working back to first principles)

  Transformative ... (converting to another/logical form)

  Scholastics ... moderns ... Kant's analytic/synthetic distinction

  The linguistic turn ...

  The cannonical biconditional universal proposition ...

  In all these cases, a key element of analysis is the process of making distinctions ... Sokolowski

  Does analysis do much at all? Meno / Moores paradox. How does analysis relate to knowledge?

  It seems so - how has it been solved ....

  Philosophers have done much more than make distinctions - Kripe uses N&N to do metaphysics

  - linguistic turn
  - making distinctions
    - Sokolowski
  - From Metaphysics to Ethics (frank jackson)
  - Tim Williamson's 'The Philosophy of Philosophy'

- Kripke's Philosophical Troubles
- Chris Daly's "Introduction to Philosophical Methods."


- inquiry is about understanding (broadly construed), not just knowledge or truth?

> the role of myth in plato

2. Simulation in Philosophy

- philosophy is hollow without thought experiments
  - because of X
- X also applies in the case of simulation
- therefore philosophy is hollow without simulation
- computational approaches have much to offer philosophy because they overcome the epistemic limitations associated with complexity, intractability, and emergence.

- there are distinct epsitemic challenges in political philosophy
  - analytic intractability
  - complexity
  - emergence


- given certain assumptions, calculate the likelihood of particular outcomes.



## Introduction (TEs are a fundamental part of philosophy)

> "Five years" says the sherif.  "That's what you're looking at. Five years in prison if you say nothing."

> "But if you talk and turn state's evidence, well then, it'll just be a few years probation."

> "Of course, if your accomplice talks first, then the deal's off.  But I'll still recommend early parole if you confess though." he continutes. "I'll let you stew over that awhile."

> It was never your intention to get caught and wind up in a prison cell but that's where you find yourself - in a 3 by 3 metre interrigation room facing a two-way mirror.  Next door, your accomplice is facing the same choice as you: stay quite as planned, withhold the crucial evidence the police lack, and you'll only have to spend a few months in prison. There's just one catch. The sherrif has just offered you a deal to become a rat and implicate your accomplice. If you do, she gets five years and you walk away with a few months probation.  Your problem is that the sherrif is also about to offer the same deal to her.

> Despite the best outcome for you both is to keep your lips closes and hold silent, the deal changes things considerably.  If your accomplice remains quite, you can rat her out and avoid prison - the two of you aren't that close anyway.  If she confesses and you don't then you'll be looking at five years instead of three.  And you know of course, that she knows this too.  So what should you do - make the best choice for both of you and stay silent or the best choice for yourself and confess?  What would a rational person do?

---

This is a thought experiment - the famous _Prisoner's Dilemma_.  A form of conceptual analysis for illustrating an abstract theory and clarifying the nature of a problem or phenomenon.  Thought experiments have been described as "processes of hypothetical reasoning that proceeds by eliciting the consequences of some projected supposition which, for aught that one actually knows to the contrary, may well be false" (@rescher2005 p3). A peculular cross of experimentation and theorising (@horowitz&massey1991), or simply as "devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things" (@brown1997).  

By framing the issue in narrative form, the thought experiment allows us to .... In this case, to better understand the conflict between individual and group rationality, and the inherent difficulties in motivaing rational and selfish individuals to work towards a common good.

Thought experiments have long been a part of philosophy.  Given there narrative, almost story telling like form that lends itself so well to oral traditions, it is likely that thought experiments actually pre-date written philosophy. According to @rescher2005 p2, pre-socratics "invented thought experimentation as a cognitive procedure and practiced it with great dedication and versatility".  Thales of Miletus (circa 620 BC) offers one of the first documented examples:

> Suppose that a like wood and other similar substances, the Earth floats in a large body of water.


Middle Ages ....


> According to Grant (2007, 201), during the late Middle Ages “the imagination became a formidable instrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that would have astonished” ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially Aristotle.


Contemporary example ....


The thought experiments described help us with our philosophical explaination, categorization, communication, and understanding.  This however, sounds a lot like run-of-the-mill conceptual analysis.  Are thought examples anything more this?  The similarities between the two methods are striking.  Conceptual analysis - the answering of questions based solely on one's grasp of the relevant concepts - is an integral part of metaphysics and philosophy (@jackson) and like the thought experiment, has been a tool of the philosopher since pre-Socratic times.  Conceptual analysis and thought experiments are deeply intertwined.  They are, according to @Nimtz2010 p189, "widely acknowledged to be essential to our armchair ways of doing philosophy". 

Conceptual analysis deals in the currency of ideas.  Like thought experiments, conceptual analysis seeks to clarify and simplify abstract and complex ideas, and most importantly, the relation between them or as @jackson p28 describes it, the "entailment theses between matters described in some preferred vocabulary and matters described in other vocabularies".  Importantly, these ideas are can be and often are _a priori_.  Both thought experiments and conceptual analysis begin with suppositions of porported truth.  These desiderata are taken to hold true and through conditional or biconditional inference, some other concept is shown to obtain (or to not).  Recourse to empiric data and _a posteriori_ claims are unnecessary once we accept the premises involved.

@Gettier1963's thought experiments about knowledge provide a good example.  Suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the proposition "Jones owns a Ford".  Her belief in this is justified because last month, she saw him driving one.  Smith has another friend Brown who is currently overseas but where, she does not know.  From the proposition "Jones owns a Ford", Smith can rightfully infer that "Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona".  But unbeknownst to Smith, Jones sold his car last week and Brown just happened to be Barcelona. So Smith has a belief - "Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona", that belief is justified, and that belief is true.  Yet we wouldn't consider this to be a case of knowledge.

According to @chalmers&jackson p6, this is a paradigmatic case of "an a priori argument, in which empirical information played no essential role, and its conclusion ... [an] example of a non-obvious a priori truth".  Gettier's thought experiment is simultaniously conceptual analysis.

But thought experiments are more than _just_ conceptual analysis.  They offer something more. @Peijnenburg&Atkinson2003 p306, for example claim that "in the view of almost everyone, a thought experiment should give sudden and exhilarating insight."  Unlike conceptual analysis in which focus can move back and forth between desiderata and entailment, thought experiments follow a more linear process where "we visualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we let it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally, we draw a conclusion" @brown1997.  

Some philosophers see thought experiments as aids to conceptual analysis. @Cohnitz2006 p389 views thought experiments as constituting "the common ground from which we start our philosophical analysis", while @Kuhn1964 p263 claims that the "thought experiment is one of the essential analytic tools which are deployed during crises and which then help to promote basic conceptual reform".  For @Nimtz2010 p190 however, the reverse is true - conceptual analysis and the tacit semantic knowledge we possess is what "entitles us to hold true the counterfactuals on which philosophical thought experiments pivot".

Another distinguishing and eponymous feature of thought experiments is their experimental nature.  Like scientific experiments, thought experiments allow us to control events, produce observations or intuitions, and confirm or disconfirm rival theories (@Blackburn 1994, p131).  They involve running a instance or model and following a logical or causal path. "Running a mental simulation is required for it to be both thought and experimental" (@Nersessian1991 p431).  Often, thought experiments offer the only alterative to scientific experimentation when physical, technological, ethical, or financial constraints make real ones impossible @Sorensen1992 p200)  In this regard, thought experiments provide evidence themselves which puts them on par with real-world experiments (@gendler2004).  

TE & Models here...

Unlike their real-world alternatives, thought experiments offer something science cannot - _a priori_ knowledge.  Thought experiments give us access to internal, instinctive knowledge @Kühne2006 p167) which in some domains like ethics, might be all we can hope for.  With them, "we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking" @SEP.  Alternatively, thought experiments act as a heuristic to deepen our understanding what we already know empirically, what @dennett has called _intuition pumps_.  Thought experiments that offer evidence or support for a theory might be called explainatory or _constructive_.

Often however, thought experiments are used _destructively_ - by demonstrating some internal contradiction or impossibility.  This is exactly what @jjt p69 does when she asks us to consider the impermissability of abortion:

> You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. 

> The director of the hospital now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? 

Thought experiments like these transfer our understanding or intuitions from one domain and apply them to another.  Even if life begins at conception and a fetus has a right to life, Thompson's thought experiment clearly demonstrates that the moral impermissability of abortion is not entails from these claims - that we would still be morally justified in disconnecting the violinist.


Not everyone agrees however...What are their limitations
  - Peijnenburg 2003 argues that phil TE's are often contractictory and question begging
  - only as good as their setting assumptions
  - replication. when is a thought experiement a new one?
  - problems data, intuition are cultural/context dependent
  - philosophical challenge remains...

> The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple: How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?


Despite these objections, thought experiments remain a fundamental part of a philosopher's toolkit....

> Derek Parfit, has defended their frequent use by stating that thought experiments arouse in us ‘strong beliefs’ (Parfit 1984, 200). (p307)

> Philosophy without thought experiments seems almost hopeless.


What's the value of TE? How are they used?

  - evoke our intuitions (dennett)
  - cheap and easy way to refute - galileo

  - Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the process of understanding (see Behmel, 2001). 

  - real demonstration isn't possible (why) (see Sorensen, 1992, pp. 200–202).
  - James McAllister has argued that in science thought experiments did not really occur before the time of Galileo (McAllister 1996).
  - They can be reconstructed and replaced by actual experiments later (Norton 1986)

  - they give us a common point around which we can collaborate see @cohntiz2006 p374

> the function of thought experiments in philosophy is to prepare the common ground upon which theories to resolve philosophical puzzles are to be constructed. @cohntiz2006 p389



# Simulation and Knowledge (What problems does simulation solve?)


- segway?
- what is it?
- how is it like TE?
- what problems does simulation solve?

The term simulation however, .....  define it

  - physical vs mental
  - EG Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer
  - simulation vs model
  - the role of time?
  - role of intervention
  - real vs hypotethical
  - explore phenomena vs communicate knowledge

> Paul Humphreys: “any computer-implemented method for exploring the properties of mathematical models where analytic methods are not available” (1991, 500).

> In its narrowest sense, a computer simulation is a program that is run on a computer and that uses step-by-step methods to explore the approximate behavior of a mathematical model. Usually this is a model of a real-world system (although the system in question might be an imaginary or hypothetical one). @winsberg2013

> More broadly, we can think of computer simulation as a comprehensive method for studying systems. 

> Winsberg 2003 (111). “Successful simulation studies do more than compute numbers. They make use of a variety of techniques to draw inferences from these numbers. Simulations make creative use of calculational techniques that can only be motivated extra-mathematically and extra-theoretically. As such, unlike simple computations that can be carried out on a computer, the results of simulations are not automatically reliable. Much effort and expertise goes into deciding which simulation results are reliable and which are not.”

> Another approach is to try to define “simulation” independently of the notion of computer simulation, and then to define “computer simulation” compositionally: as a simulation that is carried out by a programmed digital computer. On this approach, a simulation is any system that is believed, or hoped, to have dynamical behavior that is similar enough to some other system such that the former can be studied to learn about the latter.

> Simulation as an accurate approximation of some phenomena under investigation @me


> Two types of computer simulation are often distinguished: equation-based simulations and agent-based (or individual-based) simulations.

> Equation-based simulations are most commonly used in the physical sciences and other sciences where there is governing theory that can guide the construction of mathematical models based on differential equations

>  Agent-based simulations are similar to particle-based simulations in that they represent the behavior of n-many discrete individuals. But unlike equation-particle-based simulations, there are no global differential equations that govern the motions of the individuals. Rather, in agent-based simulations, the behavior of the individuals is dictated by their own local rules

 > Multiscale simulation models, in particular, couple together modeling elements from different scales of description.


Simulations needn't be restricted to the domain of computing however.
  - US engineers example
  - Kon Tiki


  - humphreys
  - winsberg
  - hartmann
  - Frigg and Reiss

- how are thought experiments and simulation related?


> the relationship between computer simulation and thought experiments has started to attract attention (see Behmel, 2001, pp. 98–108; Di Paolo et al., 2000; El Skaf and Imbert, 2013; Lenhard 2011; Stäudner, 1998).

> Accordingly, it has been argued that “computational modeling is largely replacing thought experimenting, and the latter will play only a limited role in future practice of science, especially in the sciences of complex nonlinear, dynamical phenomena” (see Chandrasekharan et al., 2012, p. 239).

> Maybe related to this is the proposal of Schulzke (2014) to think of video games philosophically as executable thought experiments.

  - TE are best thought of as a species of mental modelling.  mental simulation is a central aspect of cognition @nersessian1991 p431



###  what problems does simulation solve?


  - complexity: the model is very complex with many variables and interacting components
  - Emergence
  - analytically intractable problems, nonlinear relationships. problems without closed form expressions (In mathematics, a closed-form expression is a mathematical expression that can be evaluated in a finite number of operations.)
  - too many calculations for humans
  - invovles random variables or stochastic processes
  - communication in graphical or digital form

  - structural equations
  - experiment better by isolating variables and rerunning one-off events
  - emergence and discoverability
    - discovery vs justification

> Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. 

> (2011). Bedau argued that any conception of emergence must meet the twin hallmarks of explaining how the whole depends on its parts and how the whole is independent of its parts.

> Systems that produce emergent properties are mere mechanisms, but the mechanisms are very complex (they have very many independently interacting parts). As a result, there is no way to figure out exactly what will happen given a specific set of initial and boundary conditions, except to “crawl the causal web”.

- the limitations of simulations

  - claims about reality are only as good as a simulations fidelity to reality
  - address the "its not new knowledge" claim


- Models: 

> identify the features of these systems that were most sailent to to their investigations @weisberg2013 p4


Monte Carlo sim

 > MC simulations are computer algorithms that use randomness to calculate the properties of a mathematical model and where the randomness of the algorithm is not a feature of the target model.

> Grüne-Yanoff and Weirich (2010) offer the following reasoning: “The Monte Carlo approach does not have a mimetic purpose: It imitates the deterministic system not in order to serve as a surrogate that is investigated in its stead but only in order to offer an alternative computation of the deterministic system's properties” (p.30).

>  However, as Beisbart and Norton (2012, Other Internet Resources) point out, some MC simulations (viz. those that use MC techniques to solve stochastic dynamical equations referring to a physical system) are in fact simulations of the systems they study.

> There are three general categories of purposes to which computer simulations can be put. Simulations can be used for heuristic purposes, for the purpose of predicting data that we do not have, and for generating understanding of data that we do already have.


## Simulation in Philosophy


- how has simulation been used in other fields 
- why not so much in philosophy
- how simulation can help phil.



## Computational Philosophy as a Method

That's all well and good but how do we actually use simulation as a method what was the section I'm going to introduce an approach not calling computational philosophy or computational approaches to political philosophy.  I'm going to propose a new methodology computational approaches to political philosophy that overcomes the two biggest problems as I see them:

  1. replication and reproduction of simulation data used to justify arguments
  2. criticisms that simulations aren't accurate representations of reality

First problem of what location and reproduction is solved by, or at least mitigated by, a technique known as little of programming.  The Second solved by modelling theory rather than reality.  This approach and then in Abels all realises a third advantage – simulation is a form of communication.  In a sense literate programming of political theory allows to use simulation is a form of communication. It allows us to combine narrative argument experimentation and visualisation.

So what exactly is literate programming? Developed by the computer scientist Donald Knuth, literate programming is a way of writing software that results in documents of publishable quality which simultaniously argue for their own mathematical correctness. ((maybe fix this line)).  To program miserably one that explains the logic of software using natural language, interspersing that explanation with snippets of code.  I'm like traditional approaches to software development which typically focus on ordering on the order in source code for the computer compiler, literate programming 6 to order software the benefit the human reader.

According to Knuth:

> The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other.  p ix  

In a sense "Programming is best regarded as the process of creating _works of literature_." @knuth p ix

> The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that re ̈ınforce each other. p99

Augmented argumentation is a method allows us to combine literate programming as a method of software development with traditional philosophical argument.  Philosophy often uses formalisations to make particular claims explicit and precise.  Rather than use mathematical notation however, augmented argumentation uses computer source code as the formalisation.  This way the code that underpins simulation an intern underpins the arguments is fully explained two subject matter experts relax the requisite knowledge of code, while all the code necessary the running of situation is contained in the paper.  With literate programming, simulations and no longer black boxes this content is often difficult to obtain and check thanks to software licensing restrictions.

By making the code of simulations transparent we can overcome work with less and the likelihood the claims of philosophical argument supported by a faulty code. The code weather in the form of snippets within the argument for in the Annex of the paper is available for every reader to audit and run themselves.  This is especially important when modelling complex systems.  

The discipline of chaos theory - of deterministic systems sensitive to initial conditions - first came to white when (site the dude) discovered that tiny Errors in the rounding of floatingpoint numbers we can use weather simulations generated vastly different results.  (provide a short description of the history). 

When simulation remains blackbox available only under license or by request, the quality in The simulation code Jesus grounds for doubting the closing of the argument is supposed to support.  How do we know that the code is free of errors?  How can we trust that the code does what is claim to do?  Without access to source code, these questions cannot be answered satisfactorily.  Literate programming offers is the transparency background our confidence concerning the claims about the software even if the Individual reader lacks the skill to order the code themselves, the new fact that the code is provided with the arguments things that any possible errors a far more likely to be detected.

Little programming does introduce a new challenges however. The first which is the demands of different style an approach to software development.  It requires the code is encapsulated into smaller discrete functions maybe presented in the order benefiting the narrative of the argument rather than the order benefiting the compiler.  Is typically means all modular code is required makes heavy use the functions and macros.  Knuth describe this as "Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a _computer_ what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to _human beings_ what we want a computer to do. p99".

The other challenge is cultural rather than technical.... Code in papers!


#### The Stack 

The publication of scholarship occurs in a variety of mediums.  Historically this been printed journal all book, for the oral lecture.  The digitisation of scholarship percent publication move towards electronic formats - webpages, PDFs, video streaming, podcasts, or even MOOCs - massively open online courses.  Digitisation of scholarship has provided Turkey damages over traditional analogue methods.  The first is the use of distribution - Digital scholarship can be shared and downloaded instantly and at new zero cost.  The second is that scholarship can become more interactive.  Results can be presented graphically and in multiple dimensions.  Complex data can be visualised, queried, and explored.  Multimedia can be live streamed.



I'm going to combine literate programming using high-level languages with an almost natural language syntax with modern web technologies - coffeescript, javascript, and HTML.  Developed by Jeremy Ashkenas, coffee script is a "Little language that compiles to JavaScript".  HTML - HyperText Markup Language - is a declarative language that defines the content of webpages

It differs from JavaScript - 


- augmented argument
  - literate programming
  - why is this better?
    - simulation can be inteneded to communicate as well as investigate (@weisberg2013)
  - augmenting argument
    - beyond the paper


#### How it works

>  a program could be considered a publishable-quality document that argues mathematically for its own correctness. @random

> A different approach is that a program could be a document that teaches programming to the reader through its own example.  @random

So the definition of literate programming. Literate programming is the explanation of the program source code using natural language.  Little programming is the structure of software code so that it forms a narrative explanation of natural language.

Limit programming weeves together code and natural language explanation. 


> A literate program is an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code. Macros in a literate source file are simply title-like or explanatory phrases in a human language that describe human abstractions created while solving the programming problem, and hiding chunks of code or lower-level macros. These macros are similar to the algorithms in pseudocode typically used in teaching computer science. These arbitrary explanatory phrases become precise new operators, created on the fly by the programmer, forming a meta-language on top of the underlying programming language. @wikipedia

> A preprocessor is used to substitute arbitrary hierarchies, or rather "interconnected 'webs' of macros",[4] to produce the compilable source code with one command ("tangle"), and documentation with another ("weave"). The preprocessor also provides an ability to write out the content of the macros and to add to already created macros in any place in the text of the literate program source file, thereby disposing of the need to keep in mind the restrictions imposed by traditional programming languages or to interrupt the flow of thought. @wikipedia

Knuth Quotes

> Programming is best regarded as the process of creating _works of literature_.

> All of the major problems associated with computer programming - issues of reliability, portability learnability, maintainability, and efficiency - are ameliorated when programs and their dialogues with users become more literate.


> I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be _works of literature_. p99


Each module in literate programming is introduced at the right psychological moment because the compiler orders the code. p236

Advantages

> literate programming provides higher-quality programs, since it forces programmers to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program, making poorly thought-out design decisions more obvious. @wikipedia

> The complexity was simply too daunting for my limited brain to handle; without literate programming, the whole enterprise would have flopped miserably. ... Literate programming is what you need to rise above the ordinary level of achievement.  @knuth interview with @binstock
