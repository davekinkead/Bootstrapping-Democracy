# Philosophy & Simulation

- thought experiments
  - history
  - how they are used?
  - debate

- simulation
  - what is it?
  - how is it like TE?
  - what problems does simulation solve?

- simulation in academia
  - other fields
  - why not so much in philosophy
  - how simulation can help phil.

- augmented argument
  - literate programming
  - why is this better?
  - augmenting argument

- wrap up.



- philosophy is hollow without thought experiments
  - because of X
- X also applies in the case of simulation
- therefore philosophy is hollow without simulation
- computational approaches have much to offer philosophy because they overcome the epistemic limitations associated with complexity, intractability, and emergence.

- there are distinct epsitemic challenges in political philosophy
  - analytic intractability
  - complexity
  - emergence


- given certain assumptions, calculate the likelihood of particular outcomes.



## Introduction

> "Five years" says the sherif.  "That's what you're looking at. Five years in prison if you say nothing."

> "But if you talk and turn state's evidence, well then, it'll just be a few years probation."

> "Of course, if your accomplice talks first, then the deal's off.  But I'll still recommend early parole if you confess though." he continutes. "I'll let you stew over that awhile."

> It was never your intention to get caught and wind up in a prison cell but that's where you find yourself - in a 3 by 3 metre interrigation room facing a two-way mirror.  Next door, your accomplice is facing the same choice as you: stay quite as planned, withhold the crucial evidence the police lack, and you'll only have to spend a few months in prison. There's just one catch. The sherrif has just offered you a deal to become a rat and implicate your accomplice. If you do, she gets five years and you walk away with a few months probation.  Your problem is that the sherrif is also about to offer the same deal to her.

> Despite the best outcome for you both is to keep your lips closes and hold silent, the deal changes things considerably.  If your accomplice remains quite, you can rat her out and avoid prison - the two of you aren't that close anyway.  If she confesses and you don't then you'll be looking at five years instead of three.  And you know of course, that she knows this too.  So what should you do - make the best choice for both of you and stay silent or the best choice for yourself and confess?  What would a rational person do?

This is a thought experiment - the famous _Prisoner's Dilemma_.  It's a devise of the imagination to help investigate the nature of a particular phenomenon or problem.  In this case, the conflict between rational self interest and collective best interest.  By framing the issue in narrative form, ...

Thought experiments have always been a part of philosophy.  Given there narrative, almost story telling like form that lends itself so well to oral traditions, it is likely that thought experiments actually pre-date written philosophy.  

Plato's Allegory of the Cave is a famous early example.




Philosophy is hollow without thought experiments

  - Ship of Theseus
  - Allegory of the Cave

  - First Meditations
  - infinite god

  - JJT abortion
  - Searles Chinese Room


But what exactly are thought experiements?  @brown1997 offers a simple definition - using the imagination to investigate the nature of things.


  "In the view of almost everyone, a thought experiment should give sudden and exhilarating insight." @P&A2003 p306

  > Derek Parfit, has defended their frequent use by stating that thought experiments arouse in us ‘strong beliefs’ (Parfit 1984, 200). (p307)

  - simply examples of conceptual analysis (see Cohnitz, 2006, KIRK LUDWIG 2007).
  - Kuhn 1964 p263 "Thought experiment is one of the essential analytic tools which are deployed during crises and which then help to promote basic conceptual reform"
  - answered solely on the basis of one's grasp of the relevant concepts.
  - usually involves stating a bicondition of necessary and sufficient conditions that satisfy some concept obtaining
  - use Gettier example

  - an experiement done with thought. explaination is necessary
  - isolate features under investigation
  - observe what happens to our intituitons
  - give us 'strong beleifs' (@parfit1984 p200)

  - a species of mental modelling @Nersessian1991 p431

  - provide evidence themselves, putting them on a par with real-world experiments (see Gendler, 2004).
  - "we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking" @SEP
  - or access to instinctive knowledge (@mach1897, Kühne, 2006, pp. 165–202)

  - different types
  - different domains, not just 'science'
  - they can be investigative, refuting, supporting
  - SEP taxonomy

What's the value of TE? How are they used?

  - evoke our intuitions (dennett)
  - cheap and easy way to refute - galileo

  - Sometimes thought experiments help to illustrate and clarify very abstract states of affairs, thereby accelerating the process of understanding (see Behmel, 2001). 

  - real demonstration isn't possible (why) (see Sorensen, 1992, pp. 200–202).
  - James McAllister has argued that in science thought experiments did not really occur before the time of Galileo (McAllister 1996).
  - They can be reconstructed and replaced by actual experiments later (Norton 1986)

  - they give us a common point around which we can collaborate see @cohntiz2006 p374

> the function of thought experiments in philosophy is to prepare the common ground upon which theories to resolve philosophical puzzles are to be constructed. @cohntiz2006 p389

> Thought experiments constitute the common ground from which we start our philosophical analysis. @cohntiz2006 p389

What are their limitations

  - only as good as their setting assumptions
  
  - replication. 
  - when is a thought experiement a new one?
  - kripke busted for falsifying results of thought experiements
  
  - problems data 
    - intuition are cultural/context dependent

  - Peijnenburg 2003 argues that phil TE's are often contractictory and question begging


- TE are best thought of as a species of mental modelling.  mental simulation is a central aspect of cognition @nersessian1991 p431

Computers are ubiquitous in our lives today.  Computer networks allow us to connect and communicate with billions of people around the planet in milli-seconds.  This connectedness is transforming they way people work - they allowing an increasing number of people to work remotely from a beach in Thailand or a ski slope in Austria.  For others, this connectedness is eroding job security as many functions from accounting to radiology are being outsourced to regions with lower wage costs.  And for many more people, they ..

We are increasingly connecting not just to others but to computers themselves.  Whether its our smart phones becoming an extension of our minds (@chalmers), or Aritifical Intelligence agents becoming our assistants, our advisors, or even our bosses, computers are transforming how we live and work.

Computational approaches to investigation are also becoming far more common place in academia.  Computational Biologists use mathematical models and computer simulation to study behavioural, biological, and social systems.

These examples don't merely involve the use of computers to assist with endeavours like wordprocessesing - computers here are an essential element.

Yet this isn't the case in philosophy. Compare and constrast.  

Why is this so?

This is ashame because computations approaches have much to offer philosophy in general and social philosophy in particular.

Outline the argument.

- monte carlo to estimate probabilities

## What is Simulation?

  - lit review
  - humphreys
  - winsberg
  - hartmann
  - Frigg and Reiss


## A new type of knowledge

  - complexity and analytically intractable problems
    - too many calculations for humans
    - problems without closed form expressions
    - structural equations
  - experiment better by isolating variables and rerunning one-off events
  - emergence and discoverability
    - discovery vs justification

## Limits

  - claims about reality are only as good as a simulations fidelity to reality
  - address the "its not new knowledge" claim

## Simulation is still philosophy

  - philosophy has always done thought experiments - history
  - thought experiments are like simulation
  - so simulation is very much philosophy
