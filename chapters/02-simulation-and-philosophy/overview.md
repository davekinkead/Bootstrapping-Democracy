# Philosophy & Simulation

Computational approaches have a great deal to offer philosophy - especially social philosophy.

  - quickly define computational philosophy & simulation

Simulation offers insight in areas that traditional analytic and empiric appraches struggle.

  - complexity and analytically intractable problems
  - experiment better by isolating variables and rerunning one-off events
  - emergence and discoverability

But there are also limits to what simulation can do

  - claims about reality are only as good as a simulations fidelity to reality
  - address the "its not new knowledge" claim

Simulation is still philosophy

  - philosophy has always done thought experiments - history
  - thought experiments are like simulation
  - so simulation is very much philosophy

## Simulation isn't new

Computer simulation is new in philosophy but simulation itself isn't.

Examples of famous research using computer simulation.

My view -> Simulation is the instantiation of a model.

Explore the idea of a model.

> a model of something is a hypothetical example of it. @williamson

How has philosophy used modelling in this looser sense
