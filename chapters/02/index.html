<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Five years&quot; says the sherif. &quot;That's what you're looking at. Five years in prison if you say nothing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But if you talk and turn state's evidence, well then, it'll just be a few years probation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Of course, if your accomplice talks first, then the deal's off. But I'll still recommend early parole if you confess though.&quot; he continutes. &quot;I'll let you stew over that awhile.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was never your intention to get caught and wind up in a prison cell but that's where you find yourself - in a 3 by 3 metre interrigation room facing a two-way mirror. Next door, your accomplice is facing the same choice as you: stay quite as planned, withhold the crucial evidence the police lack, and you'll only have to spend a few months in prison. There's just one catch. The sherrif has just offered you a deal to become a rat and implicate your accomplice. If you do, she gets five years and you walk away with a few months probation. Your problem is that the sherrif is also about to offer the same deal to her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the best outcome for you both is to keep your lips closes and hold silent, the deal changes things considerably. If your accomplice remains quite, you can rat her out and avoid prison - the two of you aren't that close anyway. If she confesses and you don't then you'll be looking at five years instead of three. And you know of course, that she knows this too. So what should you do - make the best choice for both of you and stay silent or the best choice for yourself and confess? What would a rational person do?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>This is a thought experiment - the famous <em>Prisoner's Dilemma</em>. A form of analysis for illustrating an abstract concept and clarifying the nature of a problem or phenomenon. Thought experiments have long been used in philosophy. We can find them in the works of Plato .....</p>
<p>Thought experiments are ubiquitous in philosophy. what doe they do...</p>
<p>While few people would disagree with the claim that thought experiments are an important -- or at the very least -- an oft used method in philosophy, questions about philosophical methods in general are more problematic.</p>
<p>This is an important questions because it helps us answer the question of what philosophy actually <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike other disciplines, philosophy cannot be distinguished from non-philosophy by domain. why not?</p>
<p>So one possible way to identify something as philosophy is to look at what types of questions it asks - the deep stuff!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>philosophy begins with wonder...</li>
<li>what's wrong with this?</li>
</ul>
<p>But another way is to look at the methods philosophy uses...</p>
<p>The challenge with this approach is that philosophy's method appears to be just as diverse as it's domain.</p>
<p>Within analytic philosophy however, the question appears to be simpler. Philosophy is mainly modelling.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Philosophy is almost synonymous with analysis.... breaking things down into their constituent parts, translating language into abstract form, working back to first principles, and reconstituing concepts into a synthesis of new knowledge...</p>
<p>Analysis can be traced to the very beginning of philosophy. Euclid's gemotrey, Aristotles' Analytics, Plato's JTB ...</p>
<p>Here we can distinguish three distinct flavours of analysis - decompositional, regressive, and transformative ...</p>
<p>Decompositional ... (reducing comlex things to primatives)</p>
<p>Regressive ... (working back to first principles)</p>
<p>Transformative ... (converting to another/logical form)</p>
<p>Scholastics ... moderns ... Kant's analytic/synthetic distinction</p>
<p>The linguistic turn ...</p>
<p>The cannonical biconditional universal proposition ...</p>
<p>Does analysis do much at all? Meno / Moores paradox. How does analysis relate to knowledge?</p>
<p>It seems so - how has it been solved ....</p>
<p>In all these cases, a key element of analysis is the process of making distinctions ... Sokolowski</p>
<p>Philosophers have done much more than make distinctions - Kripe uses N&amp;N to do metaphysics</p>

<h2 id="thought-experiments-1">Thought Experiments</h2>
<p>Thought experiments have been described as &quot;processes of hypothetical reasoning that proceeds by eliciting the consequences of some projected supposition which, for aught that one actually knows to the contrary, may well be false&quot; (<span class="citation" data-cites="rescher2005">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rescher2005"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p3). A peculular cross of experimentation and theorising (<span class="citation" data-cites="horowitz&amp;massey1991">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="horowitz&amp;massey1991"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>), or simply as &quot;devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things&quot; (<span class="citation" data-cites="brown1997">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="brown1997"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>).</p>
<p>Thought experiments have long been a part of philosophy. By framing the issue in narrative form, the thought experiment allows us to .... In this case, to better understand the conflict between individual and group rationality, and the inherent difficulties in motivaing rational and selfish individuals to work towards a common good.</p>
<p>Given their narrative, almost story-telling like form that lends itself so well to oral traditions, it is likely that thought experiments actually pre-date written philosophy. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="rescher2005">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rescher2005"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p2, pre-socratics &quot;invented thought experimentation as a cognitive procedure and practiced it with great dedication and versatility&quot;. Thales of Miletus (circa 620 BC) offers one of the first documented examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that a like wood and other similar substances, the Earth floats in a large body of water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Middle Ages ....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Grant (2007, 201), during the late Middle Ages “the imagination became a formidable instrument in natural philosophy and theology in ways that would have astonished” ancient Greek natural philosophers, especially Aristotle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contemporary example ....</p>
<p>The thought experiments described help us with our philosophical explaination, categorization, communication, and understanding. This however, sounds a lot like run-of-the-mill conceptual analysis. Are thought examples anything more this? The similarities between the two methods are striking. Conceptual analysis - the answering of questions based solely on one's grasp of the relevant concepts - is an integral part of metaphysics and philosophy (<span class="citation" data-cites="jackson">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="jackson"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>) and like the thought experiment, has been a tool of the philosopher since pre-Socratic times. Conceptual analysis and thought experiments are deeply intertwined. They are, according to <span class="citation" data-cites="nimtz2010">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="nimtz2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p189, &quot;widely acknowledged to be essential to our armchair ways of doing philosophy&quot;.</p>
<p>Conceptual analysis deals in the currency of ideas. Like thought experiments, conceptual analysis seeks to clarify and simplify abstract and complex ideas, and most importantly, the relation between them or as <span class="citation" data-cites="jackson">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="jackson"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p28 describes it, the &quot;entailment theses between matters described in some preferred vocabulary and matters described in other vocabularies&quot;. Importantly, these ideas are can be and often are <em>a priori</em>. Both thought experiments and conceptual analysis begin with suppositions of porported truth. These desiderata are taken to hold true and through conditional or biconditional inference, some other concept is shown to obtain (or to not). Recourse to empiric data and <em>a posteriori</em> claims are unnecessary once we accept the premises involved.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Gettier1963">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Gettier1963"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>'s thought experiments about knowledge provide a good example. Suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the proposition &quot;Jones owns a Ford&quot;. Her belief in this is justified because last month, she saw him driving one. Smith has another friend Brown who is currently overseas but where, she does not know. From the proposition &quot;Jones owns a Ford&quot;, Smith can rightfully infer that &quot;Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona&quot;. But unbeknownst to Smith, Jones sold his car last week and Brown just happened to be Barcelona. So Smith has a belief - &quot;Either Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona&quot;, that belief is justified, and that belief is true. Yet we wouldn't consider this to be a case of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation" data-cites="chalmers&amp;jackson">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="chalmers&amp;jackson"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p6, this is a paradigmatic case of &quot;an a priori argument, in which empirical information played no essential role, and its conclusion ... [an] example of a non-obvious a priori truth&quot;. Gettier's thought experiment is simultaniously conceptual analysis.</p>
<p>But thought experiments are more than <em>just</em> conceptual analysis. They offer something more. <span class="citation" data-cites="Peijnenburg&amp;Atkinson2003">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Peijnenburg&amp;Atkinson2003"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p306, for example claim that &quot;in the view of almost everyone, a thought experiment should give sudden and exhilarating insight.&quot; Unlike conceptual analysis in which focus can move back and forth between desiderata and entailment, thought experiments follow a more linear process where &quot;we visualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we let it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally, we draw a conclusion&quot; <span class="citation" data-cites="brown1997">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="brown1997"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>Some philosophers see thought experiments as aids to conceptual analysis. <span class="citation" data-cites="Cohnitz2006">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Cohnitz2006"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p389 views thought experiments as constituting &quot;the common ground from which we start our philosophical analysis&quot;, while <span class="citation" data-cites="Kuhn1964">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Kuhn1964"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p263 claims that the &quot;thought experiment is one of the essential analytic tools which are deployed during crises and which then help to promote basic conceptual reform&quot;. For <span class="citation" data-cites="Nimtz2010">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Nimtz2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p190 however, the reverse is true - conceptual analysis and the tacit semantic knowledge we possess is what &quot;entitles us to hold true the counterfactuals on which philosophical thought experiments pivot&quot;.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing and eponymous feature of thought experiments is their experimental nature. Like scientific experiments, thought experiments allow us to control events, produce observations or intuitions, and confirm or disconfirm rival theories (<span class="citation" data-cites="Blackburn">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Blackburn"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> 1994, p131). They involve running a instance or model and following a logical or causal path. &quot;Running a mental simulation is required for it to be both thought and experimental&quot; (<span class="citation" data-cites="Nersessian1991">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Nersessian1991"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p431). Often, thought experiments offer the only alterative to scientific experimentation when physical, technological, ethical, or financial constraints make real ones impossible <span class="citation" data-cites="Sorensen1992">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Sorensen1992"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p200) In this regard, thought experiments provide evidence themselves which puts them on par with real-world experiments (<span class="citation" data-cites="gendler2004">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="gendler2004"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>).</p>
<p>TE &amp; Models here...</p>
<p>Unlike their real-world alternatives, thought experiments offer something science cannot - <em>a priori</em> knowledge. Thought experiments give us access to internal, instinctive knowledge <span class="citation" data-cites="Kühne2006">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Kühne2006"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p167) which in some domains like ethics, might be all we can hope for. With them, &quot;we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking&quot; <span class="citation" data-cites="SEP">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="SEP"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Alternatively, thought experiments act as a heuristic to deepen our understanding what we already know empirically, what <span class="citation" data-cites="dennett">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="dennett"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> has called <em>intuition pumps</em>. Thought experiments that offer evidence or support for a theory might be called explainatory or <em>constructive</em>.</p>
<p>Often however, thought experiments are used <em>destructively</em> - by demonstrating some internal contradiction or impossibility. This is exactly what <span class="citation" data-cites="jjt">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="jjt"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> p69 does when she asks us to consider the impermissability of abortion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The director of the hospital now tells you, &quot;Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.&quot; Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thought experiments like these transfer our understanding or intuitions from one domain and apply them to another. Even if life begins at conception and a fetus has a right to life, Thompson's thought experiment clearly demonstrates that the moral impermissability of abortion is not entails from these claims - that we would still be morally justified in disconnecting the violinist.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees however...What are their limitations - Peijnenburg 2003 argues that phil TE's are often contractictory and question begging - only as good as their setting assumptions - replication. when is a thought experiement a new one? - problems data, intuition are cultural/context dependent - philosophical challenge remains...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple: How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these objections, thought experiments remain a fundamental part of a philosopher's toolkit....</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Derek Parfit, has defended their frequent use by stating that thought experiments arouse in us ‘strong beliefs’ (Parfit 1984, 200). (p307)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy without thought experiments seems almost hopeless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's the value of TE? How are they used?</p>
