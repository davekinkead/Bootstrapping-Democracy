# Beginnings

Start with a snazzy **introduction** - maybe "This is a argument about authority and its justification".

Cover my **motivations**. Why am I doing this, what's the point of it all?  There is something intuitively appealing about democracy.  For me, it stems from the idea of autonomy.  For an individual to live well, to realise self actualisation or eudaimonia, then at the very least they must be autonomous.  A necessary condition of the good life is that it is _your_ life, of your choosing and making.  Now this in no way denies the essential role that luck, others, and society play in the causal path of lives, but it does require that in order to live well, then we are capable of, and sufficiently do, author the rules that we live by, to choose our own behaviour and life path.

Democracy, in comparison to forms of monarchy and oligarchy at least, is the system of government that best offers the chance to realise this autonomy.  Democracy provides us with a capacity for group autonomy and collective self determination.  For the choices we need to make, and the actions we might possibly take that impact others, democracy seems to be the only viable system that offers equal consideration for all our views.

But the problems of democracy are well known.  Majority tyranny, a perchance for demagogy, and the misalignment between the interests of the public and their representatives that is the inevitable result of competitive elections.  

Talk about **methodology**.  One way to critique accounts of democratic authority is to analyse them one by one, refuting specific claims of each.  Another way, one more effective but also much more demanding, is to _do a Descartes_ and pull the rug right from under accounts of democratic authority in general.

I'm going to take the latter approach. By identifying what I call democracy's existential challenges - vexing questions related to the existence, coherence, and very possibility of democratic authority.  Questions concerning the composition of democracies, of who the people ought to be; questions concerning the scope of democratic power, and how that scope should be determined; and questions concerning what procedures can be considered legitimate within democracies, and how that might be agreed upon.

Then, I will introduce my chapters.  Each chapter is a stand alone challenge to democracy.  Some challenges will apply to all accounts of democracy, others just to particular kinds.  Each challenge represents a hurdle that any _prima faeces_ plausible account of democracy will need to clear.  As such these overcoming these challenges are merely necessary conditions for a coherent justification of democratic authority.  My intuition is that none of the pre-eminent and popular contemporary accounts of democracy will 

Some accounts of democracy however, will not be challenged by any of these existential dilemmas.  But clearing these existential hurdles is far from sufficient for some democratic account to be considered justifiable.  Again, my intuition in these cases is that any account of democracy that can overcome these challenges is defective in its own right.
