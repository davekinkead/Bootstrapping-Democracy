Editor's Rejection

Thank you for sending this through to the JPS and apologies for the delay in our response. We were quite snowed under getting the latest issue of the Journal published.

I have had a look your article and I do love it, and find your results valuable and your approach extremely innovative and worthwhile, as I mentioned to you at PESA last year. However, unfortunately, I donâ€™t think it is a good fit for the JPS in its current form. Besides the graphics being beyond us at this point in time (!), the content would need to link to the philosophy in schools and/or philosophy for children (P4C) literature in some way for it to be appropriate for the JPS readership.
