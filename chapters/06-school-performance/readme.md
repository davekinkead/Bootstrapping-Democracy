Most people would accept the claim that schooling somehow affects student achievement.  After all, as a society we invest significant amounts of time and money in various endeavours trying to measure exactly this.  Measuring the impact of schooling on student achievement however, faces a significant epistemic challenge.  Because we can't measure the causal impact of schooling on student achievement directly, we can't know this causal impact with certainty.  Instead, we _infer_ the causal impact of schooling on student achievement by way of proxy measures such as student results.  If student results improve, then we can _infer_ that some aspect of schooling _caused_ this...perhaps.

How warranted is this inference from student results to school performance?  With the aid of computer simulation, I investigate the robustness of this inference mechanism in a variety of common scenarios.  By eliminating errors and abstracting away confounders, computer simulation allows us to create the ideal conditions from which to assess the quality of this inference.

I show that under a variety of common scenarios, the inference from student results to school performance is not warranted - even under ideal conditions.  Because if we can't infer school performance reliably in ideal conditions, then we certainly can't do so in the non-ideal conditions of the real world.  This article advances the literature by demonstrating in inherent difficulty, and perhaps even pointlessness, of trying to infer _school performance from student results_.
