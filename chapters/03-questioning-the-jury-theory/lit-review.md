## Majority Systems and the Condorcet Jury Theorem

Boland, P. J., 1989, “Majority systems and the Condorcet jury theorem.” Statistician, 38: 181–189.

> Condorcet argued that there are situations [the CJT assumptions] where it is advisable to entrust a decision to a group of individuals of lesser competence than to a single individual of greater competence. p181

Boland generalizes CJT for when voter competence varies and there is some dependence between voters.

Graph on p186 - the greater the dependence, the less the CJT effect.  Increasing R (the dependence between voters) is the same as decreasing N.


## Proving A Distribution-free Generalization Of The Condorcet Jury Theorem
@owen1989

> In particular, Grofman (1978) generalized the Condorcet Jury Theorem by replacing Assumption 2 (voter homo- geneity) with the assumption that voter competence is normally distributed with a variance equal to the binomial variance. p3

> Theorem II also shows us that, for large n, except for the ‘knife-edge’ case p =t, if we know p (indeed if we merely know whether p is less than or greater than +, we would know virtually all we needed to estimate group competence.  p4

> Part (3) of Theorem II, which gives the quite paradoxical result that groups which are on average ‘half-wits’ (a=+) can gener- ate a group judgmental competence anywhere from 0.39 to 0.61 - a result which does not ‘go away’ with increasing n.

## Information Aggregation, Rationality, and the Condorcet Jury Theorem.

@Austen-Smith, D. and J. S. Banks, 1996, “Information Aggregation, Rationality, and the Condorcet Jury Theorem.” American Political Science Review, 90: 34–45.

Condorcet’s Jury Theorem relies on the assumption that voting is sincere.  Austen-Smith and Banks show that sincere behaviour by all individuals is not even rational even when a common preference is held.


## When is Condorcet's Jury Theorem valid?

@Berend, D. and J. Paroush, 1998, “When is Condorcet's Jury Theorem valid?” Social Choice and Welfare, 15: 481–488.

> Abstract:  Existing proofs of Condorcet's Jury Theorem formulate only sufficient conditions for its validity. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for Condorcet's Jury Theorem. The framework of the analysis is the case of heterogeneous decisional competence, but the independence assumption is maintained.

> Condorcet believed that a group of individuals facing a binary choice and utilizing a simple majority rule would be likely to make the correct choice. p481

> A Condorcet's Jury Theorem (hereafter CJT) is a formulation of a su cient condition (or conditions) that substantiates this belief.

Lit review on relaxing assumptions:

> Recently, there have been several attempts to generalize the popular version of CJT. Berg (1993a,b) and Ladha (1992, 1995) relax the indepen- dence assumption and allow for correlated votes. Grofman et al. (1983), Owen et al. (1989) and Paroush (1998) consider distribution-free team members' competence levels. Austen-Smith et al. (1996) analyze the case of insincere voting, and Louis et al. (1996) extend the dichotomous setup to a polychotomous one. The common denominator of all these studies is that they formulate only su cient conditions for the above Condorcet's belief. 

> We adopt the dichotomous choice model with independent and sincere voting, but without any restrictions on the distribution of the decisional competence of the team members. p482

## Epistemic Democracy With Defensible Premises

DIETRICH & SPIEKERMANN 2013

> The contemporary theory of epistemic democracy often draws on the Condorcet Jury Theorem to formally justify the ‘wisdom of crowds’. But this theorem is inapplicable in its current form, since one of its premises – voter independence – is notoriously violated. This premise carries responsibility for the theorem’s misleading conclusion that ‘large crowds are infallible’. We prove a more useful jury theorem: under defensible premises, ‘large crowds are fallible but better than small groups’. This theorem rehabilitates the importance of deliberation and education, which appear inessential in the classical jury framework. Our theorem is related to Ladha’s (1993) seminal jury theorem for interchangeable (‘indistinguishable’) voters based on de Finetti’s Theorem. We also prove a more general and simpler such jury theorem.

> Put roughly: larger groups make better decisions, and very large groups are infallible. p88

> If the asymptotic conclusion applied directly to modern democracies with their large populations, these democracies would be essentially infallible when making decisions between two alternatives by simple majority. p88

> The CJT rests on two central premises. Stated roughly, the first premise is that the voters vote independently from each other, and the second premise is that each voter is competent, 

> Most believe that ‘something’ is wrong with Condorcet’s premises, p89

> deliberation and education may be crucial for the epistemic performance of groups, whereas the classical CJT suggests that they are inessential – since ‘crowds are infallible’ even without them – or even dangerous – since deliberation threatens voter independence.

Extentions

> For instance, Owen et al. (1989) prove that the asymptotic part also holds if judges are heterogeneous in competence, and Romeijn and Atkinson (2011) analyse cases of unknown competence. Different papers recognize that independence is hard to meet and/or prove jury theorems which weaken the independence assumption (e.g. Nitzan and Paroush 1984, Shapley and Grofman 1984, Boland 1989, Boland et al. 1989, Berg 1993, Estlund 1994, Kaniovski 2010, Spiekermann and Goodin 2012).

Problems with indepdendence

> To obtain a systematic account of voter (in)dependence, one must understand how the causal interactions in the voters’ institutional and deliberative environment create probabilistic dependence. p91

> Many different notions of objectivity are compatible with that assumption, as long as the right, correct or better answer is a fact that is determined entirely independently from the votes of the individuals. This excludes procedural notions of rightness, where the ‘right’ solution is right just because it was arrived at by applying the appropriate procedure. p91

> Condorcet anticipated a key theme of modern social choice theory: majority rule is at once a plausible method of collective decision making and yet subject to some surprising problems. Resolving or bypassing these problems remains one of social choice theory's core concerns.

Epistemic justifications of democracy

> Condorcet assumed that each individual is better than random at making a correct judgment (the competence assumption) and that different individuals' judgments are stochastically independent, given the state of the world (the independence assumption).

> Formally, let V1, V2, …, Vn (capital letters) denote the random variables generating the specific individual votes v1, v2, …, vn (small letters), and let V = f(V1, V2, …, Vn) denote the resulting random variable representing the social decision v = f(v1, v2, …, vn) under a given aggregation rule f, such as majority rule.  [X denoting the state of the world (1 or 0)]

> Condorcet's assumptions can be stated as follows:

> Competence: For each individual i ∈ N and each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1}, Pr(Vi = x | X = x) = p > 1/2, where p is the same across individuals and states.

> Independence: The votes of different individuals V1, V2, …, Vn are independent of each other, conditional on each value x ∈ {−1,1} of X.

> Theorem (Condorcet's jury theorem): For each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1}, the probability of a correct majority decision, Pr(V = x | X = x), is greater than each individual's probability of a correct vote, Pr(Vi = x | X = x), and converges to 1, as the number of individuals n increases.[1]


Challenging CJT Assumptions

> Although an average (not necessarily equal) individual competence above 1/2 may be sufficient for Condorcet's conclusion (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983; Boland 1989; Kanazawa 1998)

> The theorem's conclusion can also be undermined in less extreme cases (Berend and Paroush 1998), for instance when each individual's reliability, though above 1/2, is an exponentially decreasing function approaching 1/2 with increasing jury size (List 2003a).

> Although Condorcet's conclusion is robust to the presence of some interdependencies between individual votes, the structure of these interdependencies matters (e.g., Boland 1989; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1994; Dietrich and List 2004; Berend and Sapir 2007; Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013). If all individuals' votes are perfectly correlated with one another or mimic a small number of opinion leaders, the collective judgment is no more reliable than the judgment among a small number of independent individuals.

> Dietrich (2008) has argued that Condorcet's two assumptions are never simultaneously justified, in the sense that, even when they are both true, one cannot obtain evidence to support both at once.

> game-theoretic work challenges an implicit assumption of the jury theorem, namely that voters will always reveal their judgments truthfully...a voter expects a higher chance of bringing about a correct collective judgment by voting against his or her own private judgment than in line with it (Austin-Smith and Banks 1996; Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998).

> Abstract: This paper explores the role that difference plays in collective decision-making using the Condorcet jury theorem. Agents facing a dichotomous decision might prove biased toward one of the options facing them. That is, they may be more likely to decide correctly when one of the options is correct than when the other option is. A juror might be more likely to convict a guilty defendant than to acquit an innocent one. Agents may display opposing biases. This paper identifies the optimal committee composition in the presence of such bias. This composition depends upon both the prior probability that each option is correct and the relative costs of the two types of possible error (e.g., convicting an innocent defendant versus acquitting a guilty one). Optimal committee composition will be expressed in terms of the absolute (not relative) margin that a group with one form of bias should enjoy over the other.

> As originally formulated, the Condorcet jury theorem (CJT) demonstrates that col- lectives can outperform individuals p399

> The CJT therefore fails to capture the idea that decision-making benefits from presence of difference— that is, the involvement of a diversity of types of people, with different backgrounds, lifestyles, belief systems, etc. p400

The key idea here is how best to compose voters/juries when each member has different levels of type I and type II biases.

> This paper varies committee composition given the presence of opposing forms of bias within the population of potential committee members. Specifically, it offers a model in which opposite forms of bias are possible and then identifies the optimal composition for a committee deciding via majority rule. It thereby indicates how a committee might take maximal advantage of the presence of bias. p401

Finding

> These results provide qualified support for the idea that difference can contribute to collective decision-making. They also, however, indicate conditions necessary for this contribution to occur. Optimal decision-making involves heterogeneity only when q > 1 − p. (p406)
