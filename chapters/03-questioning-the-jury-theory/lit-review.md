> Condorcet anticipated a key theme of modern social choice theory: majority rule is at once a plausible method of collective decision making and yet subject to some surprising problems. Resolving or bypassing these problems remains one of social choice theory's core concerns.

## Epistemic justifications of democracy

> Condorcet assumed that each individual is better than random at making a correct judgment (the competence assumption) and that different individuals' judgments are stochastically independent, given the state of the world (the independence assumption).

> Formally, let V1, V2, …, Vn (capital letters) denote the random variables generating the specific individual votes v1, v2, …, vn (small letters), and let V = f(V1, V2, …, Vn) denote the resulting random variable representing the social decision v = f(v1, v2, …, vn) under a given aggregation rule f, such as majority rule.  [X denoting the state of the world (1 or 0)]

> Condorcet's assumptions can be stated as follows:

> Competence: For each individual i ∈ N and each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1}, Pr(Vi = x | X = x) = p > 1/2, where p is the same acrosndividuals and states.

> Independence: The votes of different individuals V1, V2, …, Vn are independent of each other, conditional on each value x ∈ {−1,1} of X.

> Theorem (Condorcet's jury theorem): For each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1}, the probability of a correct majority decision, Pr(V = x | X = x), is greater than each individual's probability of a correct vote, Pr(Vi = x | X = x), and converges to 1, as the number of individuals n increases.[1]


Challenging CJT Assumptions

> Although an average (not necessarily equal) individual competence above 1/2 may be sufficient for Condorcet's conclusion (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983; Boland 1989; Kanazawa 1998)

> The theorem's conclusion can also be undermined in less extreme cases (Berend and Paroush 1998), for instance when each individual's reliability, though above 1/2, is an exponentially decreasing function approaching 1/2 with increasing jury size (List 2003a).

> Although Condorcet's conclusion is robust to the presence of some interdependencies between individual votes, the structure of these interdependencies matters (e.g., Boland 1989; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1994; Dietrich and List 2004; Berend and Sapir 2007; Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013). If all individuals' votes are perfectly correlated with one another or mimic a small number of opinion leaders, the collective judgment is no more reliable than the judgment among a small number of independent individuals.

> Dietrich (2008) has argued that Condorcet's two assumptions are never simultaneously justified, in the sense that, even when they are both true, one cannot obtain evidence to support both at once.

> game-theoretic work challenges an implicit assumption of the jury theorem, namely that voters will always reveal their judgments truthfully...a voter expects a higher chance of bringing about a correct collective judgment by voting against his or her own private judgment than in line with it (Austin-Smith and Banks 1996; Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998).
