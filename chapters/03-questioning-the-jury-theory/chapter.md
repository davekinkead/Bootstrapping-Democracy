# Chapter


## Outline

- Aim: explore the relationship between borders and epistemic democracy

My Argument

  1. If the CJT is used to justify democracy, then certain assumptions must be present.

    - The competency assumption is difficult to demonstrate.
    - The Principle of Charity is offered in lieu of demonstration.

  2. If those assumptions are present, then majorities indicate competence (see Goodin's argument).

  3.  If competence was consistent, then majorities would be consistent.

  4.  Majorities aren't consistent, therefore competence isn't consistent.

But...

  5. The PoC doesn't isolate democracies - it is space non-specific.

  6. If we can apply it to one polity, we should be able to apply it to another similar polity.

  7. Yet given (4), even if assumptions hold for one space, they don't necessarily hold for some other similar partition.

  8. Therefore we have little to justify the Principle of Charity!


---

- test the principle of charity regarding voter competence.

- Clarify CJT & assumptions
  - Competence: better than average chance of being correct. distinguish between token and type competence.
  - Independence: chance of any two voters being correct is the product of both being correct.

- model 1: CJT with uniform competence > 0.5
- model 2: CJT with random competence > 0.5 

- introduce clustering & borders

- model 3: CJT 1 with borders
- model 4: CJT 2 with borders

- discussion of consequences

- how can we know regional competence
