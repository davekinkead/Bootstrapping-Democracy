Working Title: Competence, Inclusion, and Legitimacy - A New challenge to Condorcet's Jury Theorem

## Outline

This chapter introduces a new challenge to the Jury Theorem.  Condorcet's Jury Theorem (CJT) proves that the likelihood of a simple majority vote on some issue being correct increases to certainty as the number of voters increases to infinity, assuming that the average voter competence is better than 50%.

Demonstrating that the assumption of voter competence holds true in real life proves difficult however.  Ascertaining voter competence empirically requires some independent way of determining the what correct choice is in actual fact.  Yet if this can be known independently, using CJT to justify democracy becomes redundant.  Instead, voter competence is simply presumed by appealing to the the Principle of Charity.  After all, if randomly flipping a coin yields at 50% likelihood of being correct on a binary issue, the addition of even a modicum of reason should increase that likelihood at least a little.

Using computer simulation, I advance Goodin & Estlund's argument for the persuasiveness of democratic majorities and show that diversity of voter competence undermines the Principle of Charity.  To have any plausibility, the PoC should apply equally to indistinguishable polities.  This is not the case however.  Even if the assumptions of CJT hold true for one polity, it is unlikely they hold true for other indistinguishable polities.  Thus, we have even less reason to support the Principle of Charity than previously thought.


## My Argument

  1. If the CJT is used to justify democracy, then certain assumptions must be present.

    - The competency assumption is difficult to demonstrate.
    - The Principle of Charity is offered in lieu of demonstration.

  2. If those assumptions are present, then majorities indicate competence (see Goodin's argument).

  3.  If competence was consistent, then majorities would be consistent.

  4.  Majorities aren't consistent, therefore competence isn't consistent.

But...

  5. The PoC doesn't isolate democracies - it is space non-specific.

  6. If we can apply it to one polity, we should be able to apply it to another similar polity.

  7. Yet given (4), even if assumptions hold for one space, they don't necessarily hold for some other similar partition.

  8. Therefore we have little to justify the Principle of Charity!


---

- test the principle of charity regarding voter competence.

- Clarify CJT & assumptions
  - Competence: better than average chance of being correct. distinguish between token and type competence.
  - Independence: chance of any two voters being correct is the product of both being correct.

- model 1: CJT with uniform competence > 0.5
- model 2: CJT with random competence > 0.5 

- introduce clustering & borders

- model 3: CJT 1 with borders
- model 4: CJT 2 with borders

- discussion of consequences

- how can we know regional competence
