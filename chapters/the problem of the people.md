# The Problem of the People

---

Democracy requires a demos but the demos can't be determined democratically.  Non-democratic solutions fail to adequately explain why current political boundaries should be the way they are. The inability to properly account for who the people ought be raises other challenges to democracy's coherence and claims of legitimacy.  This has become know as the Boundary Problem.

## Literature Survey
    
Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one body politic and proclaim:

> We the people of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution. [^usa]

> Le peuple français proclame solennellement son attachement aux Droits de l’Homme... [^france]

> 日本国民は ... この憲法を確定する。 [^japan]

Yet who the people _ought_ be is a matter completely ignored by democratic theory.  Democracy requires a demos - a determinate group of political agents for whom laws are made by and on behalf of.  Throughout the history of political thought however, the existence of a demos is simply presupposed. 

### Greek history
    
### Modern history
    
Hobbes for example, thought a commonwealth is instituted "when a multitude of men do agree, and covenant" that some one or assembly of them shall be their representative [^hobbes]; for Locke it is whenever "any number of men, in the state of nature, enter into society to make one people, one body politic, under one supreme government;” [^locke].

### Recent history
    
### Historical recognition

- Dahl ([1970][@dahl1970]) described it as a 'curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem'
- Whelan ([1983][@whelan1983]) provides the first serious (and only) analysis of the problem and examines the sparsity of potential solutions
- Dahl ([1989][@dahl1989]) returns again to the issue he calls 'the problem of constituting the unit' and  'the problem of inclusion'
- Arrhenius ([2005][@arrhenius2005]) makes an unsuccessful attempt to solve the problem by invoking the all-affected principle
- Goodin ([2007][@goodin2007]) commits himself to an acknowledged unworkable enfranchisement of all affected interests.
- Erman ([2011][@erman2011]) offers a discourse-theoretical approach to the problem with the equal-influence principle
- Song ([2012][@song2012]) Asks why the demos should be bounded by the state


## My Argument


The Boundary Problem is really three distinct but interconnected problems. The first of these, what we might call the _justification problem_, is a democracy cannot determine who should be a member of it democratically. Any attempt to justify the inclusion of some people but not others within the demos will either be circular or result in an infinite regress because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to how they might decide.  Non-democratic accounts are similarly problematic.  Whether the criterion of inclusion is descriptive - nationality, linguistic, cultural, or economic salience, or geographic proximity for example - or more normative such as consent or the principle of all affected interests, we are left with the worrisome realisation that there are no satisfactory accounts for the fundamental question of who _ought_ make up the demos.

The lack of justification for who the people ought be raises two more derivative problems concerning contradiction with democratic principles and the undermining of democratic attempts to legitimate the authority of the state.  What we might call the _value problem_ arises when arbitrary methods of determining the demos conflict and contradict with core democratic values. The most fundamental of these is the principle of self-determination and self-rule.  Failure to properly define _the people_, and the subsequent over or under enfranchisement of a political association results in a state of heteronomy, the political subjugation of one group by another.

The justification problem also raises another challenge, what we might call the _predetermination problem_.  This stems from the fact that the logical and temporal priority of the _who_ over the _how_ results in the _who_ having a fundamental impact on the _how_.  Who participates in any democratic process it critical in determining the outcome of it; and given sufficient polarity and clustering of agent preferences and values across any political space, the question of inclusion fully predetermines the outcome of any democratic mechanism.  And when the basis of democracy's legitimising claims rest the difference making qualities of democratic processes, then the predetermination of outcomes renders these difference making and legitimising claims vacuous.


## The Justification Problem

The question of who ought to be included amongst demos is a matter that cannot be solved democratically.

- democracy can't solve the problem internally
	- the question of who is logically and temporally prior to what
  - democracy requires a demos
  - to have the demos determine who they are is circular
  - but why cant the demos at one time determine who they should be later on?
  - this just pushes the issue one step back - who should be in the earlier demos?
	- an infinite regress of voting on who votes ensues.
  - but what of non-democratic methods of defining the demos?
  - explore and reject them all....

## The Value Problem

- incorrectly defining the demos contradicts fundamental democratic values
  - the most fundamental democratic value is self determination - collective autonomy
    - why not political equality?
  - heteronomy is the antithesis of autonomy (explore Kant's 2nd critique)
  - incorrectly defining the demos results in heteronomy

## The Predetermination Problem

- who the people has a significant impact on how they act and what they decide
- the justification problem shows that who the people lacks normative justification
- many accounts of democratic legitimacy rely on difference making
- predetermination of the outcome of democratic processes undermines difference making claims
