# The Problem of the People

Democracy requires a demos but the demos can't be determined democratically.  Non-democratic solutions fail to adequately explain why current political boundaries should be the way they are. The inability to properly account for who the people ought be raises other challenges to democracy's coherence and claims of legitimacy.  This has become know as the Boundary Problem.

The Boundary Problem is really three distinct but interconnected problems. The first of these, what we might call the _justification problem_, is a democracy cannot determine who should be a member of it democratically. Any attempt to justify the inclusion of some people but not others within the demos will either be circular or result in an infinite regress because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to how they might decide.  Non-democratic accounts are similarly problematic.  Whether the criterion of inclusion is descriptive - nationality, linguistic, cultural, or economic salience, or geographic proximity for example - or more normative such as consent or the principle of all affected interests, we are left with the worrisome realisation that there are no satisfactory accounts for the fundamental question of who _ought_ make up the demos.

The lack of justification for who the people ought be raises two more derivative problems concerning contradiction with democratic principles and the undermining of democratic attempts to legitimate the authority of the state.  What we might call the _value problem_ arises when arbitrary methods of determining the demos conflict and contradict with core democratic values. The most fundamental of these is the principle of self-determination and self-rule.  Failure to properly define _the people_, and the subsequent over or under enfranchisement of a political association results in a state of heteronomy, the political subjugation of one group by another.

The _justification problem_ also raises a final problem, what we might call the _predetermination problem_.  This stems from the fact that the logical and temporal priority of the _who_ over the _how_ results in the _who_ having a fundamental impact on the _how_.  Who participates in any democratic process it critical in determining the outcome of it; and given sufficient polarity and clustering of agent preferences and values across any political space, the question of inclusion fully predetermines the outcome of any democratic mechanism.  And when the basis of democracy's legitimising claims rest the difference making qualities of democratic processes, then the predetermination of outcomes renders these difference making and legitimising claims vacuous.


## Defining the Demos


- democracy can't solve the problem internally
	- the question of who is logically prior to what
	- an infinite regress of voting on who votes
- all-affected principle has a strong prima facie case
	- who is affected is determined by the outcome
	- but the outcome is affected by who gets to vote
	- who is potentially affected is determined by who poses the question
	- who can pose the question has its own boundary problem
	- degree of affect also complicates the issue
	- to what extent must I be affected to have a say?
	- we'd need different jurisdictions for each issue
	- the only solution is to enfranchise all interests
	- but enfranchising someone who isn't affected reduces my autonomy just as much as disenfranchising me when I am affected.
	- the affect principle requires enfranchisement of all-and-only-affected interests
	- this reintroduces the problem of degree of affect and removes the global solution
- nationality and cultural salience provide another possibility
	- nationality follows boarders as much as boarders follow nations
	- there is no objective criteria for cultural salience
	- linguist and historical salience seem bad criteria for determining non-linguist/cultural issues
- geographic and economic features seem to delimit societies.


- Dahl ([1970][@dahl1970]) described it as a 'curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem'
- Whelan ([1983][@whelan1983]) provides the first serious (and only) analysis of the problem and examines the sparsity of potential solutions
- Dahl ([1989][@dahl1989]) returns again to the issue he calls 'the problem of constituting the unit' and  'the problem of inclusion'
- Arrhenius ([2005][@arrhenius2005]) makes an unsuccessful attempt to solve the problem by invoking the all-affected principle
- Goodin ([2007][@goodin2007]) commits himself to an acknowledged unworkable enfranchisement of all affected interests.
- Erman ([2011][@erman2011]) offers a discourse-theoretical approach to the problem with the equal-influence principle
- Song ([2012][@song2012]) Asks why the demos should be bounded by the state
