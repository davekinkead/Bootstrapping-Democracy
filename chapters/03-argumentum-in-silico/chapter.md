  - in silico vs cum silico
    - how has simulation been used
    - what is the difference?
    - how would this work?
    - (knuth literate programming)
    - how does this address the problems of simulation?
      - reproducability

## Review of Computational Philosopy


in Silico

cum Silico (Digital Humanities/Digital Philosophy)

  - some are generic DH 
  - wikis & open access (value: promotion & disemination)
  - indexing & search (value: speed of research & productivity)
  - text analysis (value: volume of research, new insights)
  - network analysis (six degrees of francis bacon) (value: new insights, visual understanding)
