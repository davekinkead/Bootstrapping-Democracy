# Argumentum in Silico

Thesis: That simulation (argumentum in silico) is a viable/valid/useful method of philosophy

Outline

## Simulation is philosophy too

  - simulation is modelling
    - what is a model
    - non-computer simulations, though experiments?
    - are there types of simulation that aren't models?

  - modelling is philosophy
    - review how modelling is used in philosophy
    - what makes modelling philsophical?


## Digital Philosophy, Computational Philosophy

** how have digital methods been used in philosophy **

  - Digital Humanities
  - wikis & open access (value: promotion & disemination)
  - indexing & search (value: speed of research & productivity)
  - text analysis (value: volume of research, new insights)
  - network analysis (six degrees of francis bacon) (value: new insights, visual understanding)
    
** simulating complex systems **

  - skryms @skyrms1996, @skyrms2004, @skyrms2010
  - list

** what are the problems with simulation **

  - (why not simulation)
  - reproducability
  - external validity


## Argumentum cum Silico, Argumentum in Silico


  - cum vs in: what is the difference?
  - how would this work?
  - (knuth literate programming)

  - how does this address the problems of simulation?
    - reproducability
    - simulates theory, not reality

  - how does it do more than just that?
    - makes assumptions explicity (relate to qualities of philosophy)
    - persuasiveness


## An Example

  - Schelling's models of segregation
  - explain why it works
