##Differing conceptions and usage of authority

au·thor·i·ty/əˈTHôritē/

Noun: 

    The power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience: "he had absolute authority over his subordinates".
    The right to act in a specified way, delegated from one person or organization to another.


> To say that a state has authority in the normative sense is to say something normative about the relationship between the state and its subjects.


Authority can be characterised along a range of dimensions:

  - Normative authority (*de jure*) vs descriptive authority (*de facto*).  Authority is de jure just if it is legitimate in a normative sense. Authority is de facto simply if the state maintains public order and it's rules are generally obeyed.  Some accounts also rely on sufficient subjects believing the authority is legitimate.
  
  - Political authority vs political power.  The latter is merely the ability realise one's will over subjects differing desires.  If de facto authority doesn't require a pro attitude, then the difference between authority and power is that the former is successful in maintaining public order.
  
  - Theoretical vs practical.  Theoretical authorities give reasons for beliefs. Practical authorities give reasons for actions
  
  - Authority as *legitimate coercion* merely requires a moral justification for the imposition of an agent's political power over others. (weak moral bonds between subject & authority)

  - Authority as *capacity to impose duties* upon subjects. (moderate moral bond)

  - Authority as a *right to rule*. There is also a distinction here between internal authority (who must be obeyed) and external authority (who may not be interfered with) (strong moral bonds for internal authorities)

  - Authority can held held by diverse institutions: legislative, judicial, executive, administrative etc.

The distinction between legitimate coercion, imposition of duties and right to rule seems vague.  Can a state maintain order (necessary for de facto authority) without coercive action against non-compliance?  Can a state rule without the imposition of duties?  

**Duty to Obey**

Christiano makes a bold claim: "The duty of the subject is grounded not in the content of the command itself but in the nature of the source issuing the command…the duty to obey is content independent or independent of the content of the particular command. One must obey because one has been commanded and not because of the particular content of the command. One must do it because one has been told to do it."

- Duties may be merely one of non-interferences with the authority or a stronger duty to obey just because it is the authority.
- Duties may be preemptive (they replace earlier duties) or non-preemptive.
- Duties may be content dependent or independent.
- Duties may be owed to the authority or to others in general.

**Wolff's Anarchism**

- An agent has a duty to realise their autonomy
- A seeks to impose duties of obedience on its subjects
- These two things are necessarily incompatible.
- ergo, states can't be legitimate

Wolff's concerns only apply to authority as a right to impose duties.

**Simmons's Anarchism**

- An agent has a right not to be subjected to another's duties
- An agent can only be bound if they have consented
- A state can't be setup so that it can demand the obedience of all and only those who consented
- ergo, states can't be legitimate

**Raz's instrumental account of normal authority**

- Raz proposes a *Normal Justification Thesis*
- "An authority does its job well and is therefore legitimate when it enables subjects to act better on the reasons that apply to them when they take the commands as giving them preemptive reasons."

**Consent Theories**

Questions

- is illegitimate authority an oxymoron? Is legitimacy a necessary, constituent factor of political authority. 
- if I recognise an authority as legitimate, do I have a duty to obey?
- does legitimacy of authority only extend to certain dimensions?

# The Authority of the State

### Leslie Green 1990

The defining characteristic of the state is that it claims supreme authority over its subjects.

> All modern states claim authority over their citizens and that is one thing that distinguishes them from bands of robbers. -- p1

Legitimacy is not a necessary condition for the existence of the state.

Just rule is a necessary but not sufficient condition for authority.

> "A state is legitimate only if, all things considered, its rule is morally justified" p5

The exercise of authority is the mean to which states achieve their objectives. Its value is conditional upon the justice of those ends. p5

Our inability to bind ourselves to unjust actions is insufficient to explain the nature of contracts in general. p8

Defines a _social relations_ perspective which values not just the form of social order but the way it is achieved. p10

Political authority is necessary for societies because of distribution problems that the market or custom cannot achieve. The state is thus required to _authoritatively allocate_ values. p11

__Two concepts of authority__ p14

1.  A has authority over B iff B regularly complies with A's requirements.
2.  A has authority over B iff A's requirement that B ø forms a premise for B's ø-ing without B considering the merits of acting as A requires

Green supports the latter view noting that an order: p19

  "is accepted as binding only if it forms a premise for the subject's action without his considering the merits of what it requires." 

## The Nature of Authority  

A complete theory of the state needs to include an account of what it is for the state to exist as a differentiated form of social order, and explain the social characteristics that distinguish it. p21

The question of justifying authority can only arise if there is an authority to justify. p22

Appeals to authority are alternatives to appeals to reason.  They seeks to generate additional reasons to act. p26

Authority can be distinguished from advice (practical vs theoretical authority) via the intention of its proclamations and reactions to non-compliance. p26

"Expert advice gives reasons for belief, not action" p27

We are in no way bound to follow the advice of experts, only those in authority. p27

Authority relations are always triadic: A has authority over B in relation to matters C. p28

"Authoritative injunctions are purported to be categorical, to bind. But that does not entail that authority must be absolute" p29

"Authority binds us to act even when we disagree with its requirements." p32

Authorities issue content independent reasons to act.  We can act contrary to the _balance of reasons_ without acting _contrary to reason._ p37

Authority is exclusionary. It's commands exclude other balance of reason calculations. p38

"Commands claim to be reasons for acting, not merely indications that there are other, and better, reasons for acting" p41

__Green's Def of Authority__ p41--42

  A has authority over B iff the fact that A requires B to ø gives B a content independent reason to ø, and excludes some of B's reasons for not ø-ing.

The institutional nature of authority is non-essential.  Institutions use, rather than explain, authority. p44

Generality is not an essential element of authority because one could have authority over another for a single discrete action (eg pushing a button) p51

_But a problem remains: If authoritative orders give content independent reasons for actions, but the scope of authority can be limited requiring content dependence, then aren't these orders just proxies for other reasons?_

__Legitimacy__

"The correct identification of a person as having authority over others depends only on certain facts about the practical reasoning of those who make or accept such claims" p59

Authority can therefore exist without being justified. p60

"Someone _claims_ authority when he makes requirements of another which he intends to be taken as binding, content-independent reasons for action; his authority is _recognised_ when another so treats the requirements; and ... _exists_ when its claims are generally recognised." p60  

All 3 are required for _de jure_ authority, while only 1 & 3 are necessary for _de facto_

## The Social Contract

Contractarianism is an attempt to show that authority would be agreed to by rational agents in the initial position of a state of nature. p122

They would do so because free cooperation is beneficial but not sustainable or stable.  All parties are aware of which actions are mutually beneficial and harmful but are not adequately motivated to perform them. p123

"It is an interesting fact about contractarian reasoning that the general economic conception of rationality of which it is a part has had its greatest success in explaining why authority is _unnecessary_ in order to attain desirable social states." p127

The competitive free market tends towards equilibrium and this equilibrium is the optimal point. (If all economic effects are internalised to the exchange relation.) p128

Pure public goods are non-rival, ie their consumption by some doesn't restrict their consumption by others, and non-excludable, ie it is very difficult to alienate them.

Essentially public goods are those that cannot be privatised such as friendship or benevolence. p129

Market failures to provide valuable public goods are often used to justify their securing via authority. Market failures are not sufficient to justify authority. p137.  To claim so requires prior authority to impose authority for the provision of the public good.

Anarchic provision of public goods further weakens claims to the necessity of authority p138.

Binding agreements presuppose the possibility of securing certain commitments and this creates a foundational dilemma for contractarians. p145 

"It is in some circumstances rational for all to agree to a mutual coercion scheme which forces them to cooperate by rendering defection too expensive and thus altering their preferences" p150

The state does more than coerce, it obligates. p151

Threats, like bargains, add to the balance of reasons. Authoritive orders are preemptive and exclusionary to other reasons.

## Consent

Consenting is a natural and common way of binding ourselves. p158

If consent could be manufactured by the state, then it would be drained of any normative force it may have to justify the state. p159

Consent is not consensus - the latter is simply broad agreement about something. The former a process of creating obligations from within our selves.

"I freely perform an action, knowing that it is understood to entail some duty, and I am therefore bound by that duty."  p165

Consent is any act done in the belief that it will create duties because it is generally know to be done with such beliefs. p166

Obligation to consent, because failure to do so would harm the state, cannot be a justification of the state.

The best account of political legitimacy may show that it doesn't exist. p166

The authority of the state is so common it is assumed to be natural, and many consent theories are attempts to explain the general authority of the state. p167

Promising _is_ a form of consent. p167

There is no settled social rule as to what counts as consent to the state's authority. p169

The greater the obligations and consequences of consent, the more explicit the method of consent needs to be. p169

Singer's argument that voting represents the second best option to personal dictatorship only shows that democracy has value, not that we are obliged to obey. p171

The 'Hard Choices' objection to consent requires a way to distinguish between 'your money or your life' situations that are clearly coercive with those that are simply lesser evil choices. p175

Assurance may also be a problem if authority is thought to be all encompassing.

Consent can bind & provide a source of political legitimacy, but consent based government is more valuable than non-consent based government. p186  It is both educative and communicative.

Just because the state doesn't have political authority over someone, doesn't mean it isn't justified in coercing them. p243

## Political Obligation

Any argument for political obligation must satisfy five criteria: p225--228

- __Morality__ Political obligation is a moral reason for action. An account of PO must show why this moral obligation exists.
- __Content Independence__ An account of PO must show why we ought obey independent of a command's contents.
- __Bindingness__ PO must bind regardless of the moral weightiness of a command
- __Particularity__ An account of PO must show why we are bound to _this_ state rather than another
- __Universality__ Why must we obey all obey all laws.  In a just state, there can be no laws that are morally inert.

"What sort of considerations are likely to apply with sufficient generality that they will cover all persons. ... it is manifestly unlikely they will be special obligations." p233

"The state has authority only if citzens have an obligation to obey" p234

"It does not follow that the state may not coerce those over which it has no authority." p243

"Political obligations will remain...[but]...the idea of a general obligation to obey, binding all people to all laws...will finally be put out of its misery." p247



# Justification and Legitimacy

### AJ Simmons 2001

Simmons argues that while currently conflated, there is an important difference between showing that the state is justified and showing it is legitimate.

Justifying something typically involves showing that it is _prudently rational_, _morally acceptable_ or both. p123

This in turn involves rebutting objections that can be _comparative_ (that it is preferable to other things) or _non-comparative_ (that it is not wrong). p124

Justifications can be _maximising_: they have to show that they defeat all objections; or _non-maximising_: they have to simlpy show they avoid violating some important principle. p124

If justifying the state means showing that _every_ state is immune to all possible objects, then this project seems impossible.  If however, it means showing that _some_ forms of state are morally defeasible, then the project is more viable. p125

That a limited state is justified - it is on balance a good thing - does not for Locke show that any particular limited state is legitimate.

Just because a state does good things, doesn't show that it has a special moral relationship with any particular subjects that gives it a right to rule them. p132

For Taylor, a "society is legitimate when members so understand and value it that they are willing to assume the disciplines and burdens which membership entails." p132  This conception however, simply reduces legitimacy to some reservoir of loyalty.

"To call a state legitimate is to say something about it...the attitudes of a state's subjects are at best a part of what argues for its legitimacy, not that in which its legitimacy consists." p133

If legitimacy is solely in the perception of subjects, then a state can increase its legitimacy via indoctrination and brain washing. p134

But binding consent cannot be given when it is unfree or uninformed.

The virtues of a state are one thing, the nature of its rights over people are another. p136

"State are not entitled to demand form unwilling inhabitants anything that one person may not demand from another independent of states." p139

"Rawlsian justification is principally a justification of coercion offer to those who already accept  the necessity of living in some kind of state." p143

Locke argues that the limited state is morally acceptable and a good deal. Rawls argues that it is justified to those already living under authority. p143
