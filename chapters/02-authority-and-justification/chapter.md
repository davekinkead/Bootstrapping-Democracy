## Authority

> To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate made me an authority myself.  
> â€• Albert Einstein

  - power vs authority. authority is normative. it should be obeyed

What's the difference between the state and the Mafia?  There are some obvious descriptive differences that immediately spring to mind - size, ethnic heritage, access to resources etc.  These don't seem to be relevant to the comparison however. States amongst themselves vary on all these criteria so perhaps similarities can be more informative.  Both the state and criminal organisations exercise power over particular geographical areas.  Both offer non-voluntary policing and protection services.  Both groups extract rents in return for those services.  And both use violence against those they ostensibly claim to serve in order to further their aims.

The key difference between the state and the mafia then, is normative [^def-normative].  While both claim power and demand obedience, and while both give us strong prudential reasons for obeying them, only in the case of the state do we have independent extra-prudential reasons for compliance.  We have moral reasons to support and obey the state that we do not have towards the Mafia.  In fact, we might even have moral reasons to actively resist or thwart criminal gangs.  This is what we mean by political authority.

[^def-normative]: By normative, I simply mean action guiding. This can encompass moral, legal, or prudential reasons for action.

  - natural language use. noun vs verb subject vs object

Despite being a fundamental subject of analysis in political philosophy, the word itself and how it is used can easily confuse.  On one hand, we use it to describe people or institutions who wield a particular flavour of power.  We talk about people _in_ authority, how the authorities might be _coming for us_ in the night, or even the _Waste System Authority of Eastern Montgomery County_ [^wsaemc].  In this sense, authority is a grammatical subject, a role, a position, or a place.

On the other we use it to describe a particular quality these subjects have - the power or right to make decisions, to give orders, and to enforce obedience.  We talk about the authority _of_ the law, tyrant who _holds_ complete authority, the speaker who _lacks_ it  Authority here is an object, a trait, a characteristic or quality.

  - political vs epistemic (see @green1990 pp26-27 @hurd2001 & @raz1986 for dissent)

The source of one's authority is equally confusing.  Authority can be derived from knowledge, skill, or expertise.  Einstein's authority in physics was a result of his pre-eminence in the field, HLA Hart's authority as a jurist came from his knowledge of the law.  Even the inanimate and the ideal can hold authority if they possess some special value or reliability [@green1990 :26].  The Bible's authority is derived from who it's authors were and whose word it documents; Jowett's or Bloom's translation of _The Republic_ are authoritative thanks to their fidelity to the original.  When authority is derived from some special knowledge, we might call it _theoretical_ or _epistemic_ authority.

The subject of this inquiry is an all together different type of authority however.  It is an authority that can not only motivate our actions for prudential reasons, but also one that can morally justify sanctions against us if we ignore it.  When we talk about the _authority of the state_, we are not referring to a governments expertise in deciding what's the right thing to do, we are referring to their issuing of commands and moral justification for punishing non-compliance.  To say that a court has authority to hear a case, that a police officer has authority to arrest, or that a legislature has authority to pass a law, means simply that their instructions are binding.  This is a _practical_ or _political_ authority.

The distinction between between _political_ and _epistemic_ authority is not so clear cut.

--> Hurd's & Raz dissent here

...As @green1990 [p26] observed however, the difference between political and epistemic authority is revelled in how the authority reacts to non-compliance by a subject.

  - de facto vs de jure. both requires belief of subjects. practical reasons require this. see also [@green1990 p11]

  - Webber. acceptance defines legitimate 

  - Hobbes disagrees. any successful power is legitimate

  - Hart. there is a difference

  - Acceptance for the right reasons.

  - Wolff. There can be no right reasons for authority.

  - There is a difference. Authority can therefore exist without being justified. [@green1990 :60],  @rawls1993
  
  - Authority as *legitimate coercion* merely requires a moral justification for the imposition of an agent's political power over others. (weak moral bonds between subject & authority) 

  - Authority as *capacity to impose duties* upon subjects. (moderate moral bond) @dworkin1986:191 legitimate authority without obligations.


  - Authority as a *right to rule*. 

  - Authority can be held by diverse institutions: legislative, judicial, executive, administrative etc.

  - There is also a distinction here between internal authority (who must be obeyed) and external authority (who may not be interfered with) (strong moral bonds for internal authorities)

  - Legitimate authorities give subjects moral reasons for obeying.  But can it also just make coercion morally permissible?

  - Authorities issue content independent reasons to act.  We can act contrary to the _balance of reasons_ without acting _contrary to reason._ @green1990 :37  It is exclusionary.

  - __Morality__ Political obligation is a moral reason for action. An account of PO must show why this moral obligation exists. @green1990 :225-228
  
  - __Content Independence__ An account of PO must show why we ought obey independent of a command's contents.
  
  - __Bindingness__ PO must bind regardless of the moral weightiness of a command
  
  - __Particularity__ An account of PO must show why we are bound to _this_ state rather than another
  
  - __Universality__ Why must we obey all obey all laws.  In a just state, there can be no laws that are morally inert.

  - conclusion: Legitimate authority requires subjects to believe they have obligations to obey for they right reasons.


## Justification

  - The language of justification is problematic.

  - Simmons: justification vs legitimisation

  - Cohen: Justification vs vindication

  - Daggar: establishment vs application of power

  - Rawls: Public justification. Legitimacy vs justice.

  - My trichotomy of justification, vindication, rationalisation.

  - epistemic requirements of justification

  - epistemic warrant

  - the entailment requirement

  - the evidentiary requirement 

  - integrate into trichotomy

  - how I will use this.

  - What is needed: an account that establishes the legitimate authority of the state plus evidence that warrants this has in fact occurred.

What's the difference between the state and a criminal organisation?  There are some obvious ones of course: size, ethnic heritage, access to resources etc.  But let's ignore these for a moment and focus on more relevant descriptive and normative criteria.  Both groups exercise power over particular geographical areas.  Both groups offer non-voluntary policing and protection services.  Both groups extract rents in return for those services.  And both groups use violence against those they ostensibly claim to serve in order to further their aims.

The key difference between the state and the mafia then, is normative.  While both claim power and want obedience, and while we have strong prudential reasons for obeying them, only in the case of the state do we have independent extra-prudential reasons for compliance.  We have moral reasons to support and obey the state that we do not have towards the mafia.  In fact, we might even have moral reasons to actively resist or thwart criminal gangs.  This is what we mean by political authority.

Political authority is what gives us reasons to obey the state but not just any reason will do.  We can have moral duties towards other citizens or governments for a variety of reasons but only some of these reasons stem from political authority.  Some of these other reasons are universal moral duties to all people.  Other reasons might be purely prudential - the difference between _de jure_ and _de facto_ authority.  These reasons might be internally or externally imposed.

It is only a special type of moral reason for action that constitutes _legitimate_ political authority.  This can be interpreted as the right to rule, the obligation to obey, or simply a justification for coercive action.  But authority as the right to rule captures too little of the concept.  Ruling in this sense becomes vacuous if there is no corresponding obligation to obey.  Authority as a justification for action however captures too much.  There might be many situations when a state's actions against a people are justified but they lack authority over those people.  Unilateral responses to externalities like climate change, or encroachment into a neutral party's territory during war are some examples of this.  Only when people have obligations to obey, may we say that those with the corresponding right to rule have authority.

Following from @green our working definition of legitimate or _de jure_ authority might be something like this.

> Someone or something has authority when their giving of content independent & pre-emptive reasons for action is sufficient to generate obligations of obedience.  When a subject has sufficient reasons to take action just because someone one believes to have authority said so.

So any account of political authority must show that (following @green and @simmons):

  - it gives subjects moral reasons for obeying
  - those reasons are content independent
  - those reasons are binding on subject
  - that all subjects must obey all laws.
  - that subjects are bound to particular states

So how can political authority be justified?  Or stated another way, under what conditions is authority _legitimate_? A first step is to distinguish between justifications that generate permissibility, obligation, and the ideal.  Another step is to examine types of moral obligations - associate, transactional, and natural duty obligation. 

Next, we must examine what it means to justify something.  While my claim is that we must believe the state has authority, does any belief count?  Here I segway to another critique of Webber and show why unfounded beliefs, contradictory or incoherent beliefs, or state brainwashing are insufficient for justifying authority.
  
We must believe the state has political authority for the right reasons. We need to know that our beliefs are warranted.  A number of accounts of when our beliefs are warranted _warrant_ are available.  @rawls offers public justification. A belief is warranted when it is supported by reasons that reasonable people would reasonably accept. This account is too strong however - it requires too much.  It fails to adequately address a criteria for reasonableness which has lead to significant debate (see @quong & @gaus).  In contrast, @rorty offers us anti-foundationalism. But this account is too weak.  It doesn't place sufficient demands on the quality of belief or its transmission.

Instead, I propose we adopt a minimalist account of the epistemic requirements of political justification - warranted transmission:

>  A subject s's justification for belief p based on evidence e transmits to p's logical consequence belief q iff:  
>
>    i)   s has justification for believing p based on e,  
>    ii)  s knows that q is deducible from p, and  
>    iii) s has justification for believing q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).

Logical consequence is the key here.  It eliminates incoherent or contradictory beliefs while being truth agnostic.  It means that validity in prior to posterior belief is a necessary condition for political authority.  And the consequence of this is that any account of political authority which is invalid cannot warrant the belief that that authority is legitimate.

We now have a framework for analysing democratic authority in the rest of this thesis.  Democratic authority may be rationalised - by offering reasons to make it tolerable _post hoc_.  Democratic authority may be vindicated - by showing that certain desirable states of affairs are a probable consequent of it (see @cohen1971). Or democratic authority may be justified - shown to be legitimate by offering reasons that are warranted.

In much the same way one might refute an argument's soundness, the account of epistemic warrant discussed above offers two vectors for criticism.  Firstly, it may be possible to show that an account of democracy fails to entail, that it's _q_ is not deducible from its _p's_.  To do this, it is necessary to demonstrate some internal contradiction within the account of democracy that makes it's conclusion about _de jure_ authority impossible - that democracy cannot justify authority in some hypothetical world.

Secondly, it may be possible to show that there is insufficient evidence to justify belief in the conditions of the account in the first place.  This would require demonstrating that we have insufficient evidential grounds for accepting an account's _p's_ in the actual world.  In the second half of this thesis, I will show that no account of democracy adequately justifies political authority.
