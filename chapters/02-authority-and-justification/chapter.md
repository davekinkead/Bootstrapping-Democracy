# Chapter

The purpose of this chapter is to assertain under what conditions do people have obligations to obey the state.

First up, we'll do a quick review of what authority is and how authority has been justified.  I am going to be very specific and argue that individuals need to believe they have obligations to obey - not for any reason - by for the right reasons.  They key thing is that they epistemic burden belongs to the individual.

Then we'll look at epistemic warrant.  

>  A subject s's justification for belief p based on evidence e transmits to p's logical consequence belief q iff:  
>
>    i)   s has justification for believing p based on e,  
>    ii)  s knows that q is deducible from p, and  
>    iii) s has justification for believing q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).

So all accounts of political authority will be taken to (at least prima facie) represent ii).  My thesis will essentially be showing how either i) can't be satisfied or how ii) is impossible.

An example:

For political authority to be justified under the doctring of the Devine Right of Kings, it must be shown that

  - some king is gods representitive on earth,
  - god exists, and
  - god's will is moral law.

If those three requirements are met, then subjects have obligations to obey.  This represents ii) s knows that q is deducible from p.

Then, evidence for each of those three requirements being true must be shown to exist.  This represents i).

So chapter 3 will look at how democratic theorists have sought to demonstrate the p -> q entailment.
