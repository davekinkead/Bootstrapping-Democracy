# The Paradox of the people

The Purpose of this chapter is show that instrumental accounts of democracy cannot satisfy the justificatory requires of political authority.

- intro. we the people. set up the question. who should they be
  - democracy begins with the people
  - it's an important question
  - outline the three problems

  - democracy can't answer the question
  - regress & question begging
  - not a fatal problem
  - other answers don't seem to work well
  - own choice
  - history
  - Nationality
  - Salience
  - all coerced
  - all affected
  - issues based
  - global demos
  - again, not fatal

- democrat vs cosmo


- instrumental accounts  
  - what do instrumental accounts do
  - those outcomes are a function of inclusion.
  - different accounts of inclusion will result in different outcomes.
  - so all instrumental AoD must also offer accounts of inclusion.
  - but no instrumental account offers an account of inclusion.
  - what about all the other accounts?
  - show why they also fail

  - rehash the requirements of justification

## Introduction

Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the people of the United States ...[^usa]

> Le peuple français proclame ...[^france]

> 日本国民は ...[^japan]

The people are the basic unit of any democracy. They are it's _raison d'etre_, the source of it's power, it's legitimacy, it's sovereignty.  As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and justify how they should organise politically.

But who exactly are _the people_? More importantly, who _should_ they be?  Answering this question properly is of fundamental importance to democracy and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  That's because all democracies require procedures in order to function - to be democratic.  Those procedures, and especially their outcomes, are a function of who is included amongst _the people_.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the boarders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.

Democratic theory, however, is silent on who they people ought be.  It can't because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it....

This chapter begins by examining how theorists have attempted to justify who the people ought be.

## Recap

  - we need epistemic warrant to obey content indepedent & preemptive reasons for action
  - that warrant consists of an entailment justification from certain political conditions to authority, as well as sufficient grounds for believing the existence of those conditions.
  - a justification fails when any of those aren't met.

In chapter 2, we examined the conditions of that any justification of political authority


In chapter 3, we saw that many justifications of democratic authority were _instrumental_.
  - instrumental AoD rely on specific outcomes.


## Meat

- why these conditions can't be satisfied.

  - those outcomes are a function of inclusion.
  - different accounts of inclusion will result in different outcomes.
  - so all instrumental AoD must also offer accounts of inclusion.
  - but no instrumental account offers an account of inclusion.
  - what about all the other accounts?
  - show why they also fail




  - what do instrumental accounts do

  - but no instrumental account offers an account of inclusion.

  - show why they also fail


## Intrumental 

There are many ways one might justify democratic authority.  In [chapter 3], we saw that one common approach is to point to the desirable outcomes that democratic procedures bring about. Democracy, according to some, identifies the right answers, produces benefiticial consequences, and leads to good policy.  We call these accounts of democracy _instrumental_. 

Sometimes the desirability of these outcomes is judged according to some independent criteria.  According to these accounts, there is some external standard for measuring the quality of a decision.  Epistemic accounts of democracy like Condorcet's Jury Theorem [@condorcet1976] or David Estund's Epistemic Proceduralism [@estlund2009] are like this.  Truth exists independently of our beliefs; democratic processes track the truth; so this gives us reason to value democracy.

Other times, we might judge the quality of democratic outcomes against some agent relative criteria.  Rather than rely on something external, the desirability of a particular result is assessed against some internal standard.  It isn't the collective decisions of democracy that matter _per se_ but how those collective decisions correspond with individual choices.  We see this in utilitarian justifications of democracy where majority voting maximizes the expected utility of voter preferences [@rae1969].  But one needn't be a utilitarian to employ such an approach - @rousseau1920 for example, argued that majority rule realises the general will of the people and this gives us reasons value it.

And for others still, it is not the particular content of democratic decision making that matters so much as the effects that democratic processes have on the participants.  Democracy changes people.  This is what @mill1862 had in mind when he argued that democracy transforms the moral character of its participants.  Democratic participation makes good citizens.  

The ends that instrumentalist accounts value are varied but they all share one similarity - _who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.  The outcome of any democratic procedure is a function, in part, of who gets to participate in that procedure.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, drawing the political line on a map in one location rather than another, will often result in different outcomes than would have otherwise occurred, even for identical democratic procedures.  Who is included in a particular democracy affects the outcomes of that democracy.

Some democratic processes are deterministic.  People vote according to their belief or preference and the voting procedures employed determines a winning outcome.  This is true for both _naive voting_, where voters believe they alone determine the outcome, as well as _strategic voting_, where voters support a choice other than their sincere preference in an attempt to increase the likelihood of an acceptable outcome [@feddersen1999]. 

In both cases, the outcome of a democratic process is fully a function of who participates in that process.  On one extreme, when voters are fully polarised, including or excluding a single voter will change the outcome of the democratic process.  At the other extreme of complete consensus, over 50% of voters would need to be replaced for the outcome to change.

Other democratic processes however, are indeterministic. This may be because voters themselves don't know how they will vote until the moment they cast their ballot, or because the decision mechanism itself is indeterminate, as in the case of sortition or selection by lottery.  Yet even in these cases, the outcome of a democratic processes remain a function of who is included in that process, because changing participants changes the likelihood of particular outcomes.
