# The Paradox of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the people of the United States ...[^usa]

> Le peuple français proclame ...[^france]

> 日本国民は ...[^japan]

The people are the basic unit of any democracy. They are it's _raison d'etre_, the source of it's power, of it's legitimacy, and of it's sovereignty.  As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and justify how they should organise politically.

But who exactly are _the people_? More importantly, who _should_ they be?  Where should we draw our borders and why?  Who gets to vote?  And who should have a say in answering these questions?  Who ought be included in the _demos_ and who ought be excluded has a profound effect on the realisation of justice, the coherence of democratic theory, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  These questions have collectively become known as the Boundary Problem of democratic theory and answering them properly is of fundamental importance to democracy and the legitimacy of democratic authority.

In [chapter 3], we saw that democracy is sometime justified on procedural grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is constituted according to some appropriate procedure.  But the appropriateness of all procedures is context-dependent.  What is fair or just in one context, or for one group of people, may not be fair or just in another.  Answering the question of who the people ought be one way rather than another can therefore change the appropriateness of the procedure.

Other times, democracy is justified on substantive grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it embodies important values and ideals.  Sometimes these ideals are universal.  Freedom and autonomy for example, seem to be valued by all people in all environments.  Sometimes these ideals are not.  The importance of the family or tribal relations for example, is valued highly in some societies but less so in others.  And even for universal values, their relative importance varies considerably amongst different peoples.  Whether liberty should take priority over equality will depend on who is being asked.  Who the people are will determine which substantive values democracy is to be justified by.

And for others still, democracy is justified on instrumental grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is the best way to produce certain valuable ends.  Democracy tracks the truth, it forms the general will, it transforms the moral character of citizens.  Those ends however, are a function of which procedures are used and who participates in those procedures.  They are a function of  who is included amongst _the people_.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the borders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.

Who the people are affects what democracies do and what democracy is.  Democratic theory, however, is silent on who they people should be.  It can't, because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it. Democratic answers are either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Non-democratic solutions however, fair little better.  A number of principles to settle the question - historical accident, nationality, cultural or linguistic salience, the all-coerced principle, and the all-affected principle - have been proposed but none offer an adequate solution. Despite the best efforts of political theorists in the last 30 years, there is a total lack of consensus as to how we might answer the question of who the people should be.  

In the part one of this chapter, I will survey the various attempts to solve the Boundary Problem ...

In part two, I will explore how these different solutions succeed and fail for different projects within democratic theory....

In part three, I will examine how different accounts of democratic inclusion affect different justifications of democracy and show that this proves fatal for instrumental justifications of democratic authority.


## No Good Answers



  - choose themselves
  - question begging
  - infinite regress
  - History is arbitrary.
  - Nationality has no objective criteria
  - Neither do other criteria of salience.
  - The all coerced principle answers the wrong question.
  - All affected principle in incompatible with westphalian states.
  - Issue based jurisdictions
  - Who get's to propose
  - A global demos.

## Democrats, Cosmopolitans, & Anarchists

  - democrats
    - no internal answer
    - external answers conflict with democratic values
  - cosmopolitans
    - external answers conflict with cosmopolitan values
  - anarchists (instrumental argument)
    - 


## Instrumental Failures


  - review of justification
    - 

This causes more concern.  Why? Hard to justify authority

Recap my account of justification.

  - we need epistemic warrant to obey content indepedent & preemptive reasons for action

  - that warrant consists of an entailment justification from certain political conditions to authority, as well as sufficient grounds for believing the existence of those conditions.

  - a justification fails when any of those aren't met.

Problem 2. Different accounts needed for different projects.

Again, not fatal


## Instrumental Justifications

There are many ways one might justify democratic authority.  In [chapter 3], we saw that one common approach is to point to the desirable outcomes that democratic procedures bring about. Democracy, according to some, identifies the right answers, produces benefiticial consequences, and leads to good policy.  We call these accounts of democracy _instrumental_. 

Sometimes the desirability of these outcomes is judged according to some independent criteria.  According to these accounts, there is some external standard for measuring the quality of a decision.  Epistemic accounts of democracy like Condorcet's Jury Theorem [@condorcet1976] or David Estund's Epistemic Proceduralism [@estlund2009] are like this.  Truth exists independently of our beliefs; democratic processes track the truth; so this gives us reason to value democracy.

Other times, we might judge the quality of democratic outcomes against some agent relative criteria.  Rather than rely on something external, the desirability of a particular result is assessed against some internal standard.  It isn't the collective decisions of democracy that matter _per se_ but how those collective decisions correspond with individual choices.  We see this in utilitarian justifications of democracy where majority voting maximizes the expected utility of voter preferences [@rae1969].  But one needn't be a utilitarian to employ such an approach - @rousseau1920 for example, argued that majority rule realises the general will of the people and this gives us reasons value it.

And for others still, it is not the particular content of democratic decision making that matters so much as the effects that democratic processes have on the participants.  Democracy changes people.  This is what @mill1862 had in mind when he argued that democracy transforms the moral character of its participants.  Democratic participation makes good citizens.  

Different democracies use different procedures and processes.  Some democratic processes are deterministic.  People vote according to their belief or preference and the voting procedures employed determines a winning outcome.  This is true for both _naive voting_, where voters believe they alone determine the outcome, as well as _strategic voting_, where voters support a choice other than their sincere preference in an attempt to increase the likelihood of an acceptable outcome [@feddersen1999].  

Other democratic processes however, are indeterministic. This may be because voters themselves don't know how they will vote until the moment they cast their ballot, or because the decision mechanism itself is indeterminate, as in the case of sortition or selection by lottery.  Yet even in these cases, the outcome of a democratic process remains a function of who is included in that process, because changing participants changes the likelihood of particular outcomes.

Even with identical procedures however, who is included in a particular democracy affects the outcomes of that democracy.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, drawing the political line on a map in one location rather than another, will often result in different outcomes than would have otherwise occurred, even for identical democratic procedures.  Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome.  Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different.  In cases of complete consensus, over 50% of voters within a democracy would need to be replaced for the outcome to change.

Both the means for deciding democratic outcomes and ends that instrumentalist accounts of democracy value vary considerably.  Determinate or indeterminate processes. Content-independent, content-relative, or content-indifferent outcomes.  They all share one similarity however - _who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.  In all cases, the outcome of a democratic process is fully a function of who participates in that process.  How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes however, depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.

Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is.  The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history.  There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state).  For each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions).  And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas.  Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.

Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters.  Different borders will produce different results, and different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion.  Content independent justifications of democracy like Condorcet's or Estlund's for example, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection.  Without this diversity within polities, democracy has no epistemic value.

Content-relative justifications of democracy like preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous for democratic preference aggregation to have value.  They only work when most voters have similar values (or can at least always work better given some other account of inclusion).  These accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion, and given the same demos, the requirements of of only one account of democracy can be met. As such, any account of democracy that is based on the instrumental value of democratic outputs must also offer a corresponding, and congruent, account of inclusion.  Failure to do so will mean that any claim of democratic authority's legitimacy is not warranted.

The dilemma for democracy is that while these instrumental accounts of democracy require the articulation of a supporting account of inclusion, democratic theory cannot offer any answers to the question of inclusion.  That's because any attempt to answer the question of inclusion - who the people ought be - democratically, results in an infinite regress.  Before we can vote on who gets to vote, we must first vote on who gets to vote for who gets to vote.

Neither can non-democratic accounts of inclusion help.  Many of these lack the sufficient normative to justify inclusion of one group over another.  Accounts of inclusion based on nationality, historic accident, linguistic, economic, or cultural salience are like this.  But accounts of inclusion that are sufficiently normative either lack sufficient specificity or enfranchise too many. The all-coerced principle merely says that anyone subject to a law must be included in the law making processes.  This however only says what is necessary for _any_ political association.  

The all-affected principle says that anyone affected by some law should have a say in the matter.  This results in either a single global demos or issue specific demoi.  A global demos is compatible with content-independent instrumental justifications but content-relative ones.  Overlapping demoi are compatible with content-relative instrumental justifications but not content-independent ones.  And neither are compatible with the current Westphalian system of states.  

Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and it is doubtful that any democratic state could be.  Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.
