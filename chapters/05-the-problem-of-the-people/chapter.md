# The Paradox of the people

The Purpose of this chapter is show that instrumental accounts of democracy cannot satisfy the justificatory requires of political authority.

- intro. we the people. set up the question. who should they be
  - democracy begins with the people
  - it's an important question
  - outline the three problems

  - democracy can't answer the question
  - regress & question begging
  - not a fatal problem
  - other answers don't seem to work well
  - own choice
  - history
  - Nationality
  - Salience
  - all coerced
  - all affected
  - issues based
  - global demos
  - again, not fatal

- democrat vs cosmo


- instrumental accounts  
  - what do instrumental accounts do
  - those outcomes are a function of inclusion.
  - different accounts of inclusion will result in different outcomes.
  - so all instrumental AoD must also offer accounts of inclusion.
  - but no instrumental account offers an account of inclusion.
  - what about all the other accounts?
  - show why they also fail

  - rehash the requirements of justification

## Introduction

Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the people of the United States ...[^usa]

> Le peuple français proclame ...[^france]

> 日本国民は ...[^japan]

The people are the basic unit of any democracy. They are it's _raison d'etre_, the source of it's power, it's legitimacy, it's sovereignty.  As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and justify how they should organise politically.

But who exactly are _the people_? More importantly, who _should_ they be?  Answering this question properly is of fundamental importance to democracy and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  That's because all democracies require procedures in order to function - to be democratic.  Those procedures, and especially their outcomes, are a function of who is included amongst _the people_.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the boarders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.

Democratic theory, however, is silent on who they people ought be.  It can't because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it....

This chapter begins by examining how theorists have attempted to justify who the people ought be.

## Recap

  - we need epistemic warrant to obey content indepedent & preemptive reasons for action
  - that warrant consists of an entailment justification from certain political conditions to authority, as well as sufficient grounds for believing the existence of those conditions.
  - a justification fails when any of those aren't met.

In chapter 2, we examined the conditions of that any justification of political authority


In chapter 3, we saw that many justifications of democratic authority were _instrumental_.
  - instrumental AoD rely on specific outcomes.


## Meat

- why these conditions can't be satisfied.

  - those outcomes are a function of inclusion.
  - different accounts of inclusion will result in different outcomes.
  - so all instrumental AoD must also offer accounts of inclusion.
  - but no instrumental account offers an account of inclusion.
  - what about all the other accounts?
  - show why they also fail




  - what do instrumental accounts do
  - those outcomes are a function of inclusion.
