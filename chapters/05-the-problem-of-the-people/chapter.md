# The Paradox of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the People of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. [^usa]

> Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania ... have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth ... [^australia]

> ... le peuple français proclame à nouveau que tout être humain, sans distinction de race, de religion ni de croyance, possède des droits inaliénables et sacrés. [^france]

> 日本国民は、... ここに主権が国民に存することを宣言し、この憲法を確定する。[^japan]

The people are the basic unit of any democracy. They are it's _raison d'etre_, the source of it's power, of it's legitimacy, and of it's sovereignty.  As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and justify how they should organise politically.

But who exactly are _the people_? More importantly, who _should_ they be?  Where should we draw our borders and why?  Who gets to vote?  And who should have a say in answering these questions?  Who ought be included in the _demos_ and who ought be excluded has a profound effect on the realisation of justice, the coherence of democratic theory, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  These questions have collectively become known as the _Boundary Problem_ of democratic theory [^naming] and answering them properly is of fundamental importance to democracy and the legitimacy of democratic authority.

In [chapter 3], we saw that democracy is sometime justified on procedural grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is constituted according to some appropriate procedure.  But the appropriateness of all procedures is context-dependent.  What is fair or just in one context, or for one group of people, may not be fair or just in another.  Answering the question of who the people ought be one way rather than another can therefore change the appropriateness of the procedure.

Other times, democracy is justified on substantive grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it embodies important values and ideals.  Sometimes these ideals are universal.  Freedom and autonomy for example, seem to be valued by all people in all environments.  Sometimes these ideals are not.  The importance of the family or tribal relations for example, is valued highly in some societies but less so in others.  And even for universal values, their relative importance varies considerably amongst different peoples.  Whether liberty should take priority over equality will depend on who is being asked.  Who the people are will determine which substantive values democracy is to be justified by.

And for others still, democracy is justified on instrumental grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is the best way to produce certain valuable ends.  Democracy tracks the truth, it forms the general will, it transforms the moral character of citizens.  Those ends however, are a function of which procedures are used and who participates in those procedures.  They are a function of  who is included amongst _the people_.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the borders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.

How the demos is constituted affects not only claims of democratic legitimacy but also the nature of democracies themselves.  The South Pacific island democracy of Tuvalu has a population of just over 10,500 people [^cite].  India, the worlds largest democracy, has a population of over 1.2 billion.  The types of governance, administration, and procedures that are appropriate for each country are vastly different.  For the Greeks, the optimal size for a democracy was the city.  Too small, and the state would be unable to sustain itself and be vulnerable to imperial neighbours. Too large, and the necessary social bonds of political life would be diluted.  Anything larger than the city-state could only be ruled by a monarch with far reaching powers.

Size isn't the only concern here.  Different conceptions of the demos result in different mixes of culture, language, and ideas.  "The same laws cannot suit so many diverse provinces with different customs, situated in the most various climates, and incapable of enduring a uniform government" [@rousseau Ch9].  Solidarity amongst homogeneous societies might be easier to find but heterogeneous groups tend be more dynamic, innovative, and productive [@haug1967].  The size of a polity impacts the system capacity of a democracy and and citizen effectiveness.  Increasing polity size tends to break the link between autonomy and participation, decreases the responsiveness of politicians, but increases state power and influence [@dahl1973].  Higher densities of populations permit deeper cooperation but have higher spillover effects and require greater levels of coordination.

Who the people are affects what democracies do and what democracy is.  Democratic theory, however, is silent on who they people should be.  It can't, because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it. Democratic answers are either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Non-democratic solutions however, fair little better.  A number of principles to settle the question - historical accident, nationality, cultural or linguistic salience, the All-Coerced Principle, and the All-Affected Principle - have been proposed but none offer an adequate solution. 

Despite the best efforts of political theorists in the last 30 years, there is a total lack of consensus as to how we might answer the question of who the people should be.  It is a "fundamental issue in democratic theory" [@arrhenius2005 p1] with "no theoretical solution to the puzzle, only pragmatic ones". A problem that presents "an important practical limit to the scope of democracy as a method of making collective decisions" [@whelan1983 p13] but one "almost totally neglected by all the great political philosophers who write about democracy" [@dahl1970 pp59-60]. 

In the part one of this chapter, I will survey the various accounts of political inclusion that are found in the literature.  Typically, who the people are is simply presumed by theorists writing on democracy.  Democracy means _rule of the people_ but the vast majority of political philosophy focus on the nature of the _kratos_ rather than the nature of the _demos_.  When consideration is given to who the people should be, it is typically descriptive criteria like nationality, culture, history, or geography that are given.  Occasionally however, normative accounts are offered like the All-Coerced Principle or the All-Affected Principle.  Despite their intuitive appeal however, these principles fail to offer an adequate solution to the Boundary Problem for a variety of reasons.

In part two, I will explore how these different accounts of inclusion succeed and fail for different projects within democratic theory.  Ideally, any answer to the question to inclusion would be democratic but as we will see shortly, this is logically impossible.  The challenge for some theorists, those I call _the Democrats_, is to either explain how analysis of democracy's _kratos_ can proceed without a democratic explanation of the _demos_; or to identify an account of inclusion that is compatible with substantive democratic values.  The Boundary Problem concerns more than just democratic compatibility however. For those theorists I call _the Cosmopolitans_, the challenge is to offer an account of inclusion that doesn't conflict with substantive universal values such as justice and fairness, and offers a justification for the externalities that arise when one people make decision that affect another.  Then there are those theorists I call _the Anarchists_.  The Anarchist is concerned primarily with how accounts of inclusion support or undermine accounts of democratic authority.  

In part three, I will explore the concerns of the Anarchists in greater detail.  Certain justifications of democratic authority, _instrumental_ ones, are fully dependent on the content of the outcomes of democratic processes.  Different accounts of inclusion lead to different _peoples_, and different _peoples_ lead to different outcomes.  First, I show that any instrumental justification of democratic authority _must_ offer a corresponding congruent account of inclusion. No instrumental justification of democratic authority does this so no instrumental justification of democratic authority satisfies the evidentiary requirement of political justification outlined in [chapter 2].  

Finally, I demonstrate that the most common instrumental justifications of democratic authority require different, and incompatible accounts of inclusion, therefore rendering these justifications incompatible themselves.  Because many accounts of democracy include multiple, and incompatible instrumental justifications, these accounts also fail to satisfy the entailment criterion of justification.  My conclusion is that the Boundary Problem is problematic for all accounts of democracy and fatal for instrumental justifications of democratic authority.


## No Good Answers

Before considering the various proposed solutions to the problem of inclusion, it is worth considering why the people can't constitute themselves.  If two or more individuals meet and decide to act as one, why aren't they a _people_?  Cooperation arises in many situations, and large scale social cooperation can emerge even amongst individuals in competition for scares resources [see @skrimms].  Why can't political associations arise from emergent cooperation or consent to a social contract from a state of nature when these ideas were clearly on the minds of early political theorists?

> When any number of men have so consented to make one community or government, they are thereby presently incorporated, and make one body politic, wherein the majority have a right to act and conclude the rest. [@locke §95]

> At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will. [@rousseau ch6]

> Which is as much as to say, to appoint one man, or assembly of men, to bear their person; and every one to own and acknowledge himself to be author of whatsoever he that so beareth their person shall act, or cause to be acted, in those things which concern the common peace and safety; and therein to submit their wills, every one to his will, and their judgements to his judgement. [@hobbes XVII]

There is nothing in short, that makes this type of process impossible nor impermissible.  There are innumerable instances of voluntary associations, whether they be political parties, churches, or sporting clubs, forming and acting jointly.  In many cases, these associations are large and complex organisations; in many cases, these organisations have rules and regulation laid down in constitutions that constrain what actions, individually or jointly, are _legitimate_.  Why not states?

Because states are non-voluntary.  _Causa sui_ accounts of inclusion like emergence or consent become highly problematic when applied to any non-voluntary association.  For Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, the need for unanimous agreement to inclusion is explicit.  These accounts fail to justify why an individual is a member of one particular people even if they wish to be member of another.  Without unanimous or prior agreement, there can no obligation for the minority to submit to the choice of the majority [@rousseau ch5]. Furthermore, it is not clear how agreement to cooperate at one time obligates the contracting parties, and especially their descendants, to continued cooperation. 

Accounts of democratic inclusion must also justify why other individuals should be excluded from one particular people even if they wish to be included amongst them. Agné presses this challenge to consent based accounts:

> Adherence to unanimous voting does not address the objection that the group of people who were permitted to participate in the unanimous decision could and perhaps should have been composed in some other way – most importantly that someone who was in fact excluded should actually have been included. [@agné2010 p386]

Social contract and consent theories are an utter failure as a response to the boundary problem because civic boundaries pose an externality problem on outsiders and require the consent of everyone.  "Boundaries require not just consent, but serial consent." [ @abizadeh2012 p875]

If people cannot decide to become a people individually (in the Westphalian sense), then neither can they decide to become a people collectively.  But why shouldn't the solution to the problem of democratic inclusion be a democratic one?  The reason of course, is that any collective action requires a subject, _the people_ in this case, to act collectively.  If the answer to the question of _who should the people should_ is _whoever the people decide_, then our account of inclusion is question begging - we cannot accept the conclusion without accepting the premises.  We become entangled in a logic of vicious circularity whenever the people asking the question are the same people in the answer.

If the people asking the question are not the same people in the answer however, then we have a different but equally intractable problem.  Before we can decide who the people should be democratically, we need to first decide which people will do the deciding.  And in order to decide _that_ matter democratically, we need to identify a prior people to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide _ad infinitum_.  When our answer and questioners are the same people, we become trapped in a loop of circular logic.  When they are different people we stumble into an infinite regress.  The question of inclusion cannot be decided democratically.


**History**

The problem can't be solved by looking inwardly to the people themselves so answers must be found outside the demos, to _extra democratic_ solutions.  The most common of these, and one that seems to underpin most _actual_ democracies is historical.  Who the people are today should be the same as who the people were yesterday....

--> The people can be defined by historical accident - those in a state are the people. But this can't solve the boundary problem when territorial issues are in dispute.

> "Democracy can be practiced for making collective decisions once the collectivity has been defined, but democratic methods themselves are inadequate to establish the bounds of the collectivity, whose existence democratic theory simple pre-supposes." [@whelan 
p22]

**Nationality**

Another common criteria for inclusion is nationality.  France should be ruled by the French. Britain by the British.  The nationalist principle - that states should correspond with pre-existing national units - has intuitive appeal thanks largely to the primacy of the nation-state in modern international relations.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples all recognise the right of all peoples to self-determination.  Nationality with it's shared cultural, linguistic, and historical bonds seems to provide strong support for the solidarity necessary in any political association.  This common sense of identity and share customs is also common to almost all independence movements of the last quarter millennium.  Basque separatism for example, is motivated in part because many people see themselves as part of the Basque and not Spanish nation.

Yet the idea of nationality is a chimera that lacks any definitive objective criterion [@whelan1984 p29, @espejo2014 p468].  If France should be ruled the French then who exactly are the French?  To answer _anyone in France_ would be circular so some pre-political explanation is needed.  Language and culture are insufficient unless many citizens of Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada are to be enfranchised whilst many current citizen of France are disenfranchised.  Neither is biological ethnicity lest citizenship depend on one's DNA.  The nationalist principle relies on too much ethnic considerations - considerations that are at odds with democratic citizenship [@abizadeh2012 p869].

Neither does nationality provide the exclusivity necessary for state sovereignty.  States can contain many nations and nations can exist across states.  Canada, Switzerland and Belgium are explicitly multi-national and multi-linguistic states but almost all states are comprised of many nationalities.  The Roma exist across many states but lack one of their own.  Further muddying the waters is the bi-causal relationship between nationality and statehood.  The fact that we can talk of the Soviet, Yugoslavian, or even the French people demonstrates that States can determine nationality just as much as nationality can determine statehood.  Nationality also fails to identify the appropriate size and level of statehood.  Is one British, English, or a Londoner first?  If France should be ruled by the French, shouldn't Alsace be ruled by the Alsatians and Paris by the Parisians?  Nationality can be too many things for it to define who the people ought be.

Closely related to history and nationality as criteria of inclusion are geography and economic salience.  Physical proximity has always been a key driver of cooperation and those geographically closest typically share common ends.  Economic interconnection parallel geographic one and provide strong _prima facie_ reason for association.

Yet physical features are a matter of perspective. Rivers divide as as often as they unite communities.  Mountain ranges are borders only to those who live on the plains [@whelan1983 p37]
Economic patterns develop in response to political boundaries, just as much as they form common bonds. p35


These reasons seem to clash with democratic values such s voluntarism, freedom and rationality. [@whelan p31]


**Coercion**

The previous principles for bounding the demos failed because they were too descriptive.  They are principles which according to [@whelan p40] "fail to command general respect".  A far more promising candidate that has obvious normative appeal is the _All-Coerced Principle_.  The appeal of this principle is immediate - anyone subject to the coercive power of the state should be given some say in how and when that power is applied.  Coercion is at odds with basic human and democratic values.  It undermines the autonomy of the person coerced [@miller2009 p221] and given the Fundamental Liberal Principle - the _a priori_ assumption in favour of freedom [Gaus 1996] - offers us a very strong demand for political inclusion.  Many theorists like [@schaffer p3] see the All-Coerced Principle expounded in many classical political works - Aristotle's "ruling and being ruled in turn" or Roman law's "what concerns all, all must discuss and approve". 

Yet the All-Coerced principle answers the wrong question.  As a necessary condition for inclusion it is straight forward enough.  If one is subject to the coercive power of the democratic state, then one is entitled to be enfranchised in that state. 



> "being coerced by a demos does generate a claim for inclusion that is far stronger than any claim that the affected interests principle is likely to generate" @miller p225

The all coerced principle answers the wrong question.

Two key principles are the affected-interests and coercion principles.  It's possible to be affected without being coerced but not vice versa. [@miller2009 p214]

*All-Affected Principle* @whelan

> Two key principles are the affected-interests and coercion principles.  It's possible to be affected without being coerced but not vice versa. @miller2009 p214 

Intuitively, all those affected by some policy ought have a voice in making it. (p16) The intuition is clear when burdens are to be imposed but not so clear that those receiving benefits ought have a say in the matter. (p17)

Yet, every decision affects people differently. Constituency would need to be determined on a per issue basis. p19

Deeper still, determining who is affected by an issue requires a prior determination of constituency, which cannot be made by those affected as this is the very question to be settled. p19

> But the AAP requires a complementary theory about affectedness - this might be an objective claim or subjective one.  @schaffer p4



All affected principle in incompatible with westphalian states.

Issue based jurisdictions

Who get's to propose

A global demos.





## Democrats, Cosmopolitans, & Anarchists

--> There seems to be no clear solution to the Boundary Problem.  Each account of inclusion discussed above offers some ....  

--> But while some solutions may work for some accounts of democracy, no solution works for all.

Just like there is a diverse range of justifications for democratic authority, there is a diversity in perspectives and projects within political and democratic theory.  In this section, I offers three new perspectives on the Boundary Problem through the eyes of what I call the Democrat, the Cosmopolitan, and the Anarchist[^1]. Different accounts of inclusion may support different democratic perspectives and projects but no single account of inclusion can support them all.  

**The Democrat**

- why it can't be answered democratically
- the conflict of extra-democratic solutions with democratic values

> The Nationalist doesn't address the issue because relies on a pre-democratic claim to justify the people, which cannot justify democracy. [@agne p385]

The Democrat is primarily concerned with answering the question democratically.  This may relate to the intractability of the Boundary Problem with procedural accounts of democracy, or the conflict of non-democratic solutions with substantive democratic values.

For the Democrat, the problem in the Boundary Problem is that any procedurally democratic solution leads to an infinite regress and founding paradox.  There can be no democracy without a _demos_.  All democratic procedures require the identification of some specified _demos_ by whom any _kratos_ is wielded.  So answering the question of who should be included in the demos democratically first requires the identification of some prior group to decide that questions.  And who should make up this group? Answering that question requires the identification of another prior group _ad infinitum_.

For the proceduralist, the Boundary Problem is a true paradox but not all accounts of democracy are procedural. Democracy however, is much more than just voting or deliberation.  It's also the realisation of substantive ideals such as political equality, popular sovereignty, or even autonomy.  @arrhenius2005 notes the distinction between democratic theories, democratic processes, and democratic values.

> "If we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." @arrhenius2005 p14

Are there any procedurally non-democratic yet substantively democratic ways of identifying a demos?  Perhaps, but as @miller2009 illustrates, different conceptions of democracy promote different, sometimes conflicting substantive values.  Radical Democrats offer a an account of democracy that requires solidarity and group identification while Liberal Democrats conception of democracy require the protection of liberty above all other ideals.

The primacy of liberty however, conflicts with the primacy of solidarity.  One conception values democracy in instrumental terms, the other intrinsically.  And this conflict plays out in how the priority of differing substantive democratic values creates different answers to the Boundary Problem.  Radicals favour inclusionary solutions for different reasons to Liberals - decision quality is higher in diverse groups while diversity limits minority oppression. Likewise, Radical favour exclusionary solutuions for different reasons to Liberals - solidarity is higher in smaller groups while respect for law is only possible with mutual respect and identity. 

So even if Democrats themselves could agree on a solution to the Boundary Problem, would that solution be acceptable to the Cosmopolitan or Anarchist?  While there may be mutually acceptable answers between Radical Democratic and Cosmopolitan, it's unlikely any solution would be acceptable to the Anarchist.  This is because few justifications of democratic authority rely on appeals to substantive democratic ideals for the simple reason that they lack what AJ Simmons calls the _particularity requirement_ - why our allegence is owed to this democratic authority rather than another.


**The Cosmopolitan**

- the conflict of solutions with cosmopolitan values
- the conflict of cosmo solutions with democratic values

The cosmopolitan's chief concern is whether the answer accords with normative principles that aren't limited to are particular people.  _Ceteris paribus_, humans have equal moral worth regardless of which polity they reside in.  The Cosmopolitan's approach to the Boundary Problem is concerned with the fairness of different groups of being subjected to different political frameworks and the normative question of who should be included and why.  

The cosmopolitan rejects claims to nationalism, culture or the status quo but can answer the question by identifying some universal principle of inclusion: the all affected principle, justice, welfare, autonomy or equality.

For the Cosmopolitan, the problem in the Boundary Problem is that democratic inclusion citizenship is closely tied to these substantive principles.  The Boundary Problem has a profound impact on individual welfare and fairness, and is therefore a challenge to the principles of justice.

Incorrectly bounding the demos means that many people are denied justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.  Incorrectly constituting the people is at offs with the Cosmopolitan's basic substantive ideals.  

**Restorative justice**

The actions of some affect others.  The actions of some countries affect others.  The externalities of some states (or members of those states) often result in significant harm to others outside of that state.

Restorative justice requires that those harmed be given some form or recourse to that harm.  Political participation is a form of restorative justice for subjects against the coercive power of the state.  

The Boundary Problem means that many people are denied restorative justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.

@simmons2013 responds that we should bite the bullet and accept that ideal theory can't deal with the boundary problem, but non-ideal theory can claim the pressing matters of distributive justice can counter the ideal problems raised by the Boundary Problem.

    "one simply cannot defend a plausible theory of domestic justice and legitimacy without first identifying the persons and territories that count as rightfully inside and rightfully outside a state’s boundaries of authority." p351


**Distributive justice**

The accidents of history and the biological lottery mean that the initial conditions of our lives, the set of rights, goods, and opportunities available to us at birth and beyond, vary greatly not just between members of our society but between members of societies themselves.

Distributive justice requires that natural, economic, legal, and social resources are distributed fairly. 

Different states and societies have different economic and political frameworks.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals having (significantly) different access to basic resources.

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with distributive justice.


**Procedural justice**

_Ceteris paribus_, justice requires that the procedures of the state for resolving disputes and allocating resources be fair between people.  Equal people should be treated equally.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals being subjected to (significantly) different rules and frameworks.

Why should someone in Finland be subjected to open and transparent rule of law when their neighbours in Russia are not (if they want it).

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with procedural justice.

The anarchist is concerned with how any answer affects democracy's ability to legitimate political authority.  I use the label anarchist very loosely, similarly to Simmons' philosophical anarchism - anyone skeptical of political authority.

>  "If existing political boundaries fail to reflect “morally respectable” solutions to the problem of the need for localized justice, why should we take the legitimate territorial jurisdictions of existing states or the genuine political obligations of their claimed subjects to be determined by such a morally tainted process?" 
> 
> -- @simmons2013 p332

**The Anarchist**

- challenges vs illegitimacy
- how instrumental accounts are fatally undermined

> To the extent that the unit within which majority rule operates is unjustifiable, then majority rule is unjustifiable in that unit. @dahl1989 p193


Recall from [chapter 2] what it means to justify political authority.  Political authories issue content independent and pre-emptive reasons for action.  Authority, if it is to be distinguished from brute power, needs to have substantive normative content.  It must be able to impose political obligations to itself, on those that are subject to it.  These political obligations must be moral reasons for actions.  Prudential motivation, such as to avoid harm or punishment, is not enough.  

These reasons for action however, must be content independent.  The nature of authority is such that one doesn't obey because they good reasons were given, and neither because one agrees with them.  The nature of authority is such that one obeys because of _who_ gave the reasons.  These reasons must also be exclusionary.  If a state is to have political authority, then when its agents issue commands, these must trump other reasons for acting contrary to those commands.  When subjects obey an authority, they are not weighing a balance of reasons to act but rather act because authority pre-empts other reasons for action.  Finally, any account of political authority must show why subjects are bound to particular authorities - why subjects are should be citizens of this state, rather than another.


--> requirements of justification

--> general impact of the boundary problem on general accounts


## Instrumental Failures

The Anarchist concern about the Boundary Problem turns out to be graver than has been addressed in the literature to date.  The inability to adequately answer the question of who the people should be is certainly problematic for accounts of democratic authority but the challenges presented thus far have not been fatal to democracy's claims of legitimacy.  For certain accounts however, it is.  

We have already seen that a common way to justify democratic authority is _instrumentally_.  In this final part, I press the anarchist challenge further and demonstrate how the question of who the people should be fatally undermines the evidentiary requirement for all instrumental justifications of democratic authority, and the entailment requirement for some of them.

Instrumental accounts rely on the desirable outcomes that democratic procedures bring about. Democracy, instrumentalists claim, identifies the right answers, produces beneficial consequences, or leads to good policy.  Sometimes the desirability of these outcomes is judged according to some independent criteria.  According to these accounts, there is some external standard for measuring the quality of a decision.  Epistemic accounts of democracy like Condorcet's Jury Theorem [@condorcet1976] or David Estund's Epistemic Proceduralism [@estlund2009] are like this.  Truth exists independently of our beliefs; democratic processes track the truth; so this gives us reason to value democracy.

Other times, we might judge the quality of democratic outcomes against some agent relative criteria.  Rather than rely on something external, the desirability of a particular result is assessed against some internal standard.  It isn't the collective decisions of democracy that matter _per se_ but how those collective decisions correspond with individual choices.  We see this in utilitarian justifications of democracy where majority voting maximizes the expected utility of voter preferences [@rae1969].  But one needn't be a utilitarian to employ such an approach - @rousseau1920 for example, argued that majority rule realises the general will of the people and this gives us reasons value it.

And for others still, it is not the particular content of democratic decision making that matters so much as the effects that democratic processes have on the participants.  Democracy changes people.  This is what @mill1862 had in mind when he argued that democracy transforms the moral character of its participants.  Democratic participation makes good citizens.  

Different democracies use different procedures and processes.  Some democratic processes are deterministic.  People vote according to their belief or preference and the voting procedures employed determines a winning outcome.  This is true for both _naive voting_, where voters believe they alone determine the outcome, as well as _strategic voting_, where voters support a choice other than their sincere preference in an attempt to increase the likelihood of an acceptable outcome [@feddersen1999].  

Other democratic processes however, are indeterministic. This may be because voters themselves don't know how they will vote until the moment they cast their ballot, or because the decision mechanism itself is indeterminate, as in the case of sortition or selection by lottery.  Yet even in these cases, the outcome of a democratic process remains a function of who is included in that process, because changing participants changes the likelihood of particular outcomes.

Even with identical procedures however, who is included in a particular democracy affects the outcomes of that democracy.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, drawing the political line on a map in one location rather than another, will often result in different outcomes than would have otherwise occurred, even for identical democratic procedures.  Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome.  Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different.  In cases of complete consensus, over 50% of voters within a democracy would need to be replaced for the outcome to change.

Both the means for deciding democratic outcomes and ends that instrumentalist accounts of democracy value can vary considerably.  Democratic processes can be determinate or indeterminate. Outcomes can be judged as content-independent, content-relative, or content-indifferent.  But they all share one similarity - _who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.  In all cases, for any given democratic procedure, the outcome of that democratic procedure is fully a function of who participates in that process. _Who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.

How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes however, depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.  Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is.  The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are largely arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history.  There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state).  

For each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions).  And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas.  Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.  The variability of possible polities demands specificity.

Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters.  Different borders will produce different results, different results justify different accounts of democracy, therefore different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion.  Content independent justifications of democracy such as Condorcet's or Estlund's, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection.  Condorcet's Jury Theorem for example, requires that there is a better than average chance that any independent voter is correct on some issue.  But even when this is true for some distribution of voters, it is not necessarily true for any partition of voters.

If the epistemic competence (or what ever content-independent criterion underpins the instrumental account of democracy) is tightly clustered, then how the demos is constituted becomes crucially important. Elsewhere [^under-review] I have demonstrated that clustering of the epistemic competence amongst agents in any political space undermines instrumental justifications of democracy when alternative partitions of the space are possible.  

In the figure below, we see how the epistemic virtue of majority voting in a hypothetical political space - the difference between the underlying epistemic competence of individual agents and that of the majority - is large when agents are uniformly distributed across the space.  As agents become more clustered however (represented here on a scale of 0.0 for no clustering and 1.0 for complete clustering), the epistemic performance of majority voting decreases until there is not difference between majority vote and randomly selecting an individual voter.

This means that when agents or voter competence is uniformly distributed, the question of who the people are is irrelevant for content-independent instrumental justifications of democratic authority.  Any account of inclusion will do.  But when voter competence is not uniformly distributed, the question of who the people are becomes critical.  The more clustered agents or voter competence is, the more necessary a congruent account of inclusion becomes.  When voter competence is highly clustered, only a few accounts of inclusion will be compatible with a content-independent justifications of democracy.  Content-independent justifications of democracy require homogeneity between polities but heterogeneity within them.  Without this characteristic, democracy has no epistemic value.

[^under-review]: See my 'Border and Legitimacy' (under review) @kinkead2015 for a detailed discussion of this.  Pre-print available at http://dave.kinkead.com.au/modelling-the-boundary-problem/

Content-relative justifications of democracy such as preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous for democratic preference aggregation to have value.  They only work when most voters have similar values (or can at least always work better given some other account of inclusion).  These accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion, and given the same demos, the requirements of of only one account of democracy can be met. As such, any account of democracy that is based on the instrumental value of democratic outputs must also offer a corresponding, and congruent, account of inclusion.  Failure to do so will mean that any claim of democratic authority's legitimacy is not warranted.

The dilemma for democracy is that while these instrumental accounts of democracy require the articulation of a supporting account of inclusion, democratic theory cannot offer any answers to the question of inclusion.  That's because any attempt to answer the question of inclusion - who the people ought be - democratically, results in an infinite regress.  Before we can vote on who gets to vote, we must first vote on who gets to vote for who gets to vote.

Neither can non-democratic accounts of inclusion help.  Many of these lack the sufficient normative to justify inclusion of one group over another.  Accounts of inclusion based on nationality, historic accident, linguistic, economic, or cultural salience are like this.  But accounts of inclusion that are sufficiently normative either lack sufficient specificity or enfranchise too many. The all-coerced principle merely says that anyone subject to a law must be included in the law making processes.  This however only says what is necessary for _any_ political association.  

The all-affected principle says that anyone affected by some law should have a say in the matter.  This results in either a single global demos or issue specific demoi.  A global demos is compatible with content-independent instrumental justifications but content-relative ones.  Overlapping demoi are compatible with content-relative instrumental justifications but not content-independent ones.  And neither are compatible with the current Westphalian system of states.  

Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and it is doubtful that any democratic state could be.  Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.
