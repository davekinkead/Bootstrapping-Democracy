# The Paradox of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the People of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. [^usa]

> Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania ... have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth ... [^australia]

> ... le peuple français proclame à nouveau que tout être humain, sans distinction de race, de religion ni de croyance, possède des droits inaliénables et sacrés. [^france]

> 日本国民は、... ここに主権が国民に存することを宣言し、この憲法を確定する。[^japan]

The people are the basic unit of any democracy. They are its _raison d'etre_, the source of its power, of its legitimacy, and of its sovereignty.  As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and justify how they should organise politically.

But who exactly are _the people_? More importantly, who _should_ they be?  Where should we draw our borders and why?  Who gets to vote?  And who should have a say in answering these questions?  Who ought to be included in the _demos_ and who ought to be excluded has a profound effect on the realisation of justice, the coherence of democratic theory, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  These questions have collectively become known as the _Boundary Problem_ of democratic theory [^other-names] and answering them properly is of fundamental importance to democracy and the legitimacy of democratic authority.


[^other-names]: The _Boundary Problem of Democratic Theory_ has gone by a number of names in political theory.  @dahl1989 [p. 193] has called it "the problem of the unit" while @goodin2007 [p.42] refers to it as the problem of "constituting the demos".  Most other theorists have settled on "the Boundary Problem".

In [Chapter 3], we saw that democracy is sometimes justified on procedural grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is constituted according to some appropriate procedure.  But the appropriateness of all procedures is context-dependent.  What is fair or just in one context, or for one group of people, may not be fair or just in another.  Answering the question of who the people should be in one way rather than another can therefore change the appropriateness of the procedure.

Other times, democracy is justified on substantive grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it embodies important values and ideals.  Sometimes these ideals are universal.  Freedom and autonomy, for example, seem to be valued by all people in all environments.  Sometimes however, these ideals are not.  The importance of the family or tribal relations for example, is valued highly in some societies but less so in others.  Even for universal values, their relative importance varies considerably amongst different peoples.  Whether liberty should take priority over equality will depend on who is being asked.  Who the people are will determine which substantive values democracy is to be justified by.

Another view is that democracy can be justified on instrumental grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is the best way to produce certain valuable ends.  Democracy tracks the truth, it forms the general will, and it transforms the moral character of citizens.  Those ends however, are a function of which procedures are used and who participates in those procedures.  They are a function of  who is included amongst _the people_.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the borders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.

How the _demos_ is constituted affects not only claims of democratic legitimacy but also the nature of democracies themselves.  The South Pacific island democracy of Tuvalu has a population of just over 10,500 people.  India, the worlds largest democracy, has a population of over 1.2 billion.  The types of governance, administration, and procedures that are appropriate for each country are vastly different.  For the Greeks, the optimal size for a democracy was the city.  Too small, and the state would be unable to sustain itself and be vulnerable to neighbours with imperial aspirations. Too large, and the social bonds necessary for political life would be diluted.  Anything larger than the city-state could only be ruled by a monarch with far reaching powers.

Size isn't the only concern here.  Different conceptions of the _demos_ result in different mixes of culture, language, and ideas.  "The same laws cannot suit so many diverse provinces with different customs, situated in the most various climates, and incapable of enduring a uniform government" [@rousseau1920 Ch9].  Solidarity amongst homogeneous societies make cooperation easier but heterogeneous groups tend be more dynamic, innovative, and productive [@haug1967].  The size of a polity impacts the system capacity of a democracy and the effectiveness of citizen.  Increasing polity size tends to break the link between autonomy and participation, decreases the responsiveness of politicians, but increases state power and influence [@dahl1973].  Higher densities of populations permit deeper cooperation but have higher spillover effects and require greater levels of coordination.

Who the people are affects what democracies do and what democracy is.  Democratic theory however, is silent on who the people should be.  It can't, because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it. Democratic answers are either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Non-democratic solutions however, fair little better.  A number of principles to settle the question - historical accident, nationality, cultural or linguistic salience, the All-Coerced Principle, and the All-Affected Principle - have been proposed but none offer an adequate solution. 

Despite the best efforts of political theorists over the last 50 years, there is a total lack of consensus as to how we might answer the question of who the people should be.  It is a "fundamental issue in democratic theory" [@arrhenius2005 p1] with "no theoretical solution to the puzzle, only pragmatic ones". It is a problem that presents "an important practical limit to the scope of democracy as a method of making collective decisions" [@whelan1983 p13] but one "almost totally neglected by all the great political philosophers who write about democracy" [@dahl1970 pp59-60]. 

In the Part One of this chapter, I will survey the various accounts of political inclusion that are found in the literature.  Typically, who the people are is simply presumed by theorists writing on democracy.  Democracy means _rule of the people_ but the vast majority of political philosophy focuses on the nature of the _kratos_ rather than the _demos_.  When consideration is given to who the people should be, it is typically descriptive criteria like nationality, culture, history, or geography that are given.  Occasionally however, normative accounts are offered like the All-Coerced Principle or the All-Affected Principle.  Despite their intuitive appeal, these principles fail to offer an adequate solution to the Boundary Problem for a variety of reasons.

In Part Two, I will explore how these different accounts of inclusion succeed and fail for different projects within democratic theory.  Ideally, any answer to the question of inclusion would be democratic but as we will see shortly, this is logically impossible.  The challenge for some theorists, those I call _the Democrats_, is to either explain how analysis of democracy's _kratos_ can proceed without a democratic explanation of the _demos_, or to identify an account of inclusion that is compatible with substantive democratic values.  Nevertheless, the Boundary Problem concerns more than just democratic compatibility. For those theorists I call _the Cosmopolitans_, the challenge is to offer an account of inclusion that doesn't conflict with substantive universal values such as justice and fairness, and offers a justification for the externalities that arise when one _demos_ makes decisions that affect another.  There are also those theorists I call _the Anarchists_.  The Anarchist is concerned primarily with how accounts of inclusion support or undermine accounts of democratic authority.  

In Part Three, I will explore the concerns of the Anarchists in greater detail.  Certain justifications of democratic authority, _instrumental_ ones, are fully dependent on the content of the outcomes of democratic processes.  Different accounts of inclusion lead to different _peoples_, and different _peoples_ lead to different outcomes.  First, I show that any instrumental justification of democratic authority _must_ offer a corresponding congruent account of inclusion. No instrumental justification of democratic authority does this so no instrumental justification of democratic authority satisfies the evidentiary requirement of political justification outlined in [Chapter 2].  

Finally, I demonstrate that the most common instrumental justifications of democratic authority require different and incompatible accounts of inclusion, rendering these justifications incompatible themselves.  Because many accounts of democracy include multiple, and incompatible instrumental justifications, these accounts also fail to satisfy the entailment criterion of justification.  My conclusion is that the Boundary Problem is problematic for all accounts of democracy and fatal for instrumental justifications of democratic authority.


## No Good Answers

Before considering the various proposed solutions to the problem of inclusion, it is worth considering why the people can't constitute themselves.  If two or more individuals meet and decide to act as one, why aren't they a _people_?  Cooperation arises in many situations, and large scale social cooperation can emerge even amongst individuals in competition for scares resources [see @skyrms2004].  Why can't political associations arise from emergent cooperation or consent to a social contract from a state of nature when these thoughts were clearly on the minds of early political theorists?  According to @locke1988 [§95]:

> When any number of men have so consented to make one community or government, they are thereby presently incorporated, and make one body politic, wherein the majority have a right to act and conclude the rest.

Similarly, @rousseau1920 [ch6] argued that:

> At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will.

While @hobbes1651 [XVII] insisted that: 

> Which is as much as to say, to appoint one man, or assembly of men, to bear their person; and every one to own and acknowledge himself to be author of whatsoever he that so beareth their person shall act, or cause to be acted, in those things which concern the common peace and safety; and therein to submit their wills, every one to his will, and their judgements to his judgement.

There is nothing in short, that makes this type of process impossible nor impermissible.  There are innumerable instances of voluntary associations, whether they be political parties, churches, or sporting clubs, forming and acting jointly.  In many cases, these associations are large and complex organisations; in many cases, these organisations have rules and regulation laid down in constitutions that constrain what actions, individually or jointly, are _legitimate_.  Why not states?

Because states are non-voluntary.  _Causa sui_ accounts of inclusion like emergence or consent become highly problematic when applied to any non-voluntary association.  For Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, the need for unanimous agreement to inclusion is explicit.  These accounts fail to justify why an individual is a member of one particular people even if they wish to be member of another.  Without unanimous or prior agreement, there can no obligation for the minority to submit to the choice of the majority [@rousseau1920 ch5]. Furthermore, it is not clear how agreement to cooperate at one time obligates the contracting parties, and especially their descendants, to continued cooperation. 

Accounts of democratic inclusion must also justify why other individuals should be excluded from one particular people even if they wish to be included amongst them. Hans Agné presses this challenge to consent based accounts:

> Adherence to unanimous voting does not address the objection that the group of people who were permitted to participate in the unanimous decision could and perhaps should have been composed in some other way – most importantly that someone who was in fact excluded should actually have been included. [@agné2010 p386]

Social contract and consent theories are an utter failure as a response to the boundary problem because civic boundaries pose an externality problem on outsiders and require the consent of everyone, even those outside the _demos_.  "Boundaries require not just consent, but serial consent." [@abizadeh2012 p875]

If people cannot decide to become _a people_ individually, then neither can they decide to become a people collectively.  But why shouldn't the solution to the problem of democratic inclusion be a democratic one?  The reason of course, is that any collective action requires a subject, in this case _the people_, to act collectively.  If the answer to the question of _who should the people be_ is _whoever the people decide_, then our account of inclusion is question begging - we cannot accept the conclusion without accepting the premises.  We become entangled in a web of vicious circularity whenever the people asking the question are the same people in the answer.

If the people asking the question are not the same people in the answer however, then we have a different but equally intractable problem.  Before we can decide who the people should be democratically, we need to first decide which people will do the deciding.  And in order to decide _that_ matter democratically, we need to identify a prior people to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide _ad infinitum_.  When the _who_ of our answer and and the _who_ asking the question are the same, we become trapped in a loop of circular logic.  When they are different people we stumble into an infinite regress.  The question of inclusion cannot be decided democratically.

The problem can't be solved by looking inwardly to the people themselves because democratic methods are inadequate to establish the bounds of the collectivity, whose existence democratic theory simple pre-supposes [@whelan1983 p22].  We must therefore look for answers outside the demos, to _extra democratic_ solutions.  The most common of these, and one that seems to underpin most _actual_ democracies is _historical justification_.  Who the people are today should be the same as who the people were yesterday.  Use the lines on the map from last year, this year.

This response risks the same circularity as the democratic solution.  We can't claim that the _demos_ should be just those bounded by the state when the appropriate boundaries of the state are the very matter in question.  Modern states are demarcated by their territorial sovereignty and the exclusive rights they claim over people in designated physical spaces.  The legitimacy of democratic states however, is closely tied to who their people are.  Who the people are determines the boundaries of the state.  So we cannot use the state to determine the people when the people determine the state.

Removing the circularity fails to help.  If we assert that it is the state that determines the people and not the people that determine the state, then this question of fundamental importance to democracy becomes hostage to historical accident.  The question of _who the people should be_, the matter that affects democratic function, identity, and legitimacy, is answered by the political and military struggles from the past.  The answer to important normative questions becomes arbitrary - one determined by statesmen and generals of history whose actions over territorial disputes one can safely assume were not motivated by concern for the future democratic legitimacy.

This is not to say however, that the _demos_ shouldn't be bounded by the territorial state.  @song2012 [p59] for example, argues that the mutual trust and solidarity necessary for any functional democracy provides a _prima facie_ case for a territorial answer to the boundary problem.  The state is the best way of securing the constitutive conditions of democracy.  It serves as the primary site of solidarity conducive to democratic participation and establishes clear links between representatives and their constituents.  The people must be represented by a political state, therefore existing boundaries provide a solution.

Yet even if we accept the argument that territorial association is necessary for democracy, this in no way entails that historical accident should define by _which_ state the _demos_ is bounded.  The state may be useful for democracy, it may be important or even necessary.  But the state, when its boundaries are defined by historical accident, is not sufficient for democracy and does not answer the question of who the people should be.

Another common criteria for inclusion in actual democracies is nationality.  France should be ruled by the French. Britain by the British.  The nationalist principle - that states should correspond with pre-existing national units - has intuitive appeal thanks largely to the primacy of the nation-state in modern international relations.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples all recognise the right of all peoples to self-determination.  Nationality with its shared cultural, linguistic, and historical bonds seems to provide strong support for the solidarity necessary in any political association.  This common sense of identity and share customs is also common to almost all independence movements of the last quarter millennium.  Basque separatism for example, is motivated in part because many people see themselves as part of the Basque and not Spanish nation.

Yet the idea of nationality is a chimera that lacks any definitive objective criterion [@whelan1983 p29, @espejo2014 p468].  If France should be ruled the French then who exactly are the French?  To answer _anyone in France_ would be circular so some pre-political explanation is needed.  Language and culture are insufficient unless many citizens of Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada are to be enfranchised whilst many current citizen of France are disenfranchised.  Neither is biological ethnicity lest citizenship depend on one's DNA.  The nationalist principle relies on too much ethnic considerations - considerations that are at odds with democratic citizenship [@abizadeh2012 p869].

Neither does nationality provide the exclusivity necessary for state sovereignty.  States can contain many nations and nations can exist across states.  Canada, Switzerland and Belgium are explicitly multi-national and multi-linguistic states but almost all states are comprised of many nationalities.  The Roma exist across many states but lack one of their own.  Further muddying the waters is the bi-causal relationship between nationality and statehood.  The fact that we can talk of the Soviet, Yugoslavian, or even the French people demonstrates that states can determine nationality just as much as nationality can determine statehood.  Nationality also fails to identify the appropriate size and level of statehood.  Is one British, English, or a Londoner first?  If France should be ruled by the French, shouldn't Alsace be ruled by the Alsatians and Paris by the Parisians?  Nationality can be too many things for it to define who the people ought be.

Closely related to history and nationality as criteria of inclusion are geography and economic salience.  Physical proximity has always been a key driver of cooperation and those geographically closest typically share common ends.  Economic interconnection parallel geographic one and provide another strong _prima facie_ reason for association.  Physical features are a matter of perspective however.  As [@whelan1983 p37] notes, Rivers divide as as often as they unite communities.  Mountain ranges are borders only to those who live on the plains.  A quick glance at satellite imagery is all that is needed to demonstrate that economic patterns develop in response to political boundaries, just as much as they form common bonds.

The principles for bounding the _demos_ discussed so far failed because they were too descriptive.  They are principles which according to [@whelan1983 p40] "fail to command general respect".  A far more promising candidate that has obvious normative appeal is the _All-Coerced Principle_.  The appeal of this principle is immediate - anyone subject to the coercive power of the state should be given some say in how and when that power is applied.  Coercion is at odds with basic human and democratic values.  It undermines the autonomy of the person coerced [@miller2009 p221] and given the Fundamental Liberal Principle - the _a priori_ assumption in favour of freedom [@gaus1996] - offers us a very strong demand for political inclusion.  Many theorists like [@schaffer2012 p3] see the All-Coerced Principle expounded in many classical political works - Aristotle's "ruling and being ruled in turn" or Roman law's "what concerns all, all must discuss and approve". 

Yet the All-Coerced Principle answers the wrong question.  As a necessary condition for inclusion it is straight forward enough.  If one is subject to the coercive power of the democratic state, then democratic legitimacy demands that one is entitled to be enfranchised in that state.  Legitimate democratic states may sometimes be justified in coercing those they don't enfranchise. It might be the case that visitors and other aliens may be legitimately subjected to one state's laws when they are present in that state, despite being given no say in how those laws are formed.  For citizens and those the state claims authority over though, the All-Coerced Principle seems to support the demand for inclusion.  The All-Coerced Principle can tell us who should be included _if_ they are subject to the coercive force of the state, but not who the state is permitted to coerce in the first place.

It is obvious that when one is coerced, one is affected, yet it's also possible to be affected without being coerced [@miller2009 p214].  Intuitively, anyone who is affected by the decisions of a government should have the right to participate in that government (@dahl1970 p64, @whelan1983 p16).  The All-Affected Principle, the articulation of this intuition, has been offered by many theorists as a promising candidate to solve the Boundary Principle (@whelan1983, @shapiro1999, @gould2004, @arrhenius2005, @goodin2007).  Unlike the All-Coerced Principle, the All-Affected Principle asks the right question.  It has a pre-political yet normative basis to it.

While promising, the All-Affected Principle is not without its own problems.  The first of which is to determine an appropriate account of affect.  Exactly how affected does one need to be in order to demand a say in the matter?  Coercion, physical harm, or economic loss seem highly plausible but what of moral offence, inconvenience, or _faux pas_?  The All-Affected Principle requires a complementary theory about affectedness which might be an objective claim or subjective one [@schaffer2012 p4].  While Mill's [-@mill1859] Harm Principle or Burnheim's [-@burnheim2006] account of Legitimate Material Interest may offer guidance here, the nature as well as degree of affect is also important.  As @whelan1983 [p17] observes, our intuitions are clearer when burdens are to be imposed but not so clear whether those receiving benefits ought have a say in the matter.

Assuming that we can adequately explain what degree of affect is sufficient to justify inclusion amongst the people, the fact remains that different decisions affect people differently.  Some issues, like water quality, might affect many people equality within one geographical region.  Others, like marriage equality, might only affect a subset of the population but do so globally.  Constituency based on the All-Affected Principle would need to be determined on a per issue basis, resulting in an overlapping mesh of political jurisdictions.  Delving deeper still, determining who is affected by an issue requires a prior determination of constituency, which cannot be made by those affected as this is the very question to be settled [@whelan1983 p19].  Who is affected by an issue is determined by what the issue is and how the issue is decided.  For example, the decision of a country to compensate former colonies for past injustice will affect the people in both the former colony and colonialist differently depending on how the matter is resolved.  Compensating makes some better off and others worse off.  Not compensating has different results.  Who is affected therefore depends not only on the issue to be decided but also who gets to propose the issue to be decided - who is potentially affected.  And determining who can propose what issue results in a new Boundary Problem of its very own.

One solution is a global demos.  By enfranchising all potentially affected interests, everyone is given a voice, and the dilemma of excluding affected people is overcome.  As  [@agné2010 p390] notes:

> "Humanity is not just another group of human beings. It is all of them together. By defining the founding category as inclusive of the whole world, no one will be excluded."

A number of political theorists have endorsed this move (@goodin2007, @agné2010, @abizadeh2012, @saunders2012) but it is not one without its own challenges.  Both the global demos and overlapping issue based constituencies are wholly incompatible with the current Westphalian system of nation states.  This by itself is not a fatal objection.  If the only coherent solution to the Boundary Problem is the All-Affected Principle, then this simply means that the current international system lacks normative justification from this perspective.  

What is highly problematic for the global demos solution however, is that it is at odds with substantive democratic values and the motivations of the All-Affected Principle itself.  The motivating intuition of the All-Affected Principle is that anyone affected by some decision should have a say in that decision.  The corollary of this is that the decision making power of the _demos_ ought to be limited to distributing benefits and burdens internally and not to affecting outsiders [@saunders2012 p290].  The concern here is _under_ inclusion in the demos because it erodes the autonomy of outsiders.  Yet _over_ inclusion is equally damaging to autonomy.  Enfranchising those not affected by a decision erodes an individuals voice on some matter just like disenfranchisement does.  If 1000 people including myself are affected by some issue, then enfranchising all of us realises our collective autonomy.  I have the maximum 1/1000th of control permitted by equality.  But if 1 billion people are enfranchised, then the voice of the 1000 affected is diluted almost to nothing and they are held hostage to the whims of those not affected.


## Democrats, Cosmopolitans, & Anarchists

## Instrumental Failures

The Anarchist concern about the Boundary Problem turns out to be graver than has been addressed in the literature to date.  The inability to adequately answer the question of who the people should be is certainly problematic for accounts of democratic authority but the challenges presented thus far have not been fatal to democracy's claims of legitimacy.  Nevertheless, for certain accounts however, it is.  Recall from [Chapter 2] what it means to justify political authority.  Political authorities issue content independent and pre-emptive reasons for action.  Authority, if it is to be distinguished from brute power, needs to have substantive normative content.  It must be able to impose political obligations to itself, upon those that are subject to it.  These political obligations must be moral reasons for actions.  Prudential motivation, such as to avoid harm or punishment, is not enough.  

These reasons for action however, must be content independent.  The nature of authority is such that one doesn't obey because good reasons were given, and neither because one agrees with the reasons given.  Authority demands that one obeys just because of _who_ gives the reasons.  These reasons must also be exclusionary.  If a state is to have political authority, then when its agents issue commands, these must trump other reasons for acting contrary to those commands.  When subjects obey an authority, they are not weighing a balance of reasons to act but rather act because authority pre-empts other reasons for action.  Finally, any account of political authority must show why subjects are bound to particular authorities - why subjects should be citizens of this state, rather than another.

Effective political authority requires that a sufficient large body of the people willingly acquiesces to its power.  The complexity of modern states is such that prudential reasons for compliance, the avoidance of punishment and penalty alone, are not enough for effective rule.  Citizens must believe the state has the right to rule and that they have obligations to obey it.  If an authority is to _actually_ be legitimate - to be considered _de jure_ rather than simply _de facto_ - its subjects must believe it to be legitimate.  Not for just any reason however.  For _de jure_ political authority, its subjects must believe it to be legitimate for the right reasons. They must have epistemic warrant for that belief.

There are many ways that political authority can be justified.  Accounts of political authority such as the divine right of kings, consent, fair play, and democratic autonomy have all been proposed as ways that obligations to obey are imposed upon subjects.  The citizens of a state are epistemically warranted in their belief that their state has legitimate authority whenever an account of authority satisfies two conditions.  The first is the _entailment requirement_ which holds that if certain conditions or states of affairs are realised, then the obligation to obey an authority exists.  This requirement is a hypothetical conditional and forms the bulk of most accounts of political authority.  The second is the _evidentiary requirement_ which demands that the antecedent conditions in the entailment requirement are, in fact, realised.  Claims of political authority can therefore be rejected via two means. The evidentiary requirements can be shown to not hold true in reality, or the entailment requirement can be shown to be impossible due to contradiction or incoherence.  The rejection of either, or both, is sufficient for us to reject a particular account of political authority.

We have already seen that a common way to justify democratic authority is _instrumentally_.  In the final part of this chapter, I press the anarchist challenge further and demonstrate how the question of _who the people should be_ fatally undermines the evidentiary requirement for all instrumental justifications of democratic authority, and the entailment requirement for some of them.  Instrumental accounts of democracy rely on the desirable outcomes that democratic procedures bring about. Democracy, instrumentalists claim, identifies the right answers, produces beneficial consequences, or leads to good policy.  Sometimes the desirability of these outcomes is judged according to some independent criteria.  According to these accounts, there is some external standard for measuring the quality of a decision.  Epistemic accounts of democracy like Condorcet's Jury Theorem [@condorcet1976] or David Estund's Epistemic Proceduralism [@estlund2009] which claim that majority voting is most likely to identify correct answers under certain conditions are like this.  Truth exists independently of our beliefs; democratic processes track the truth; so this gives us reason to value democracy.

Other times, we might judge the quality of democratic outcomes against some agent relative criteria.  Rather than rely on something external, the desirability of a particular result is assessed against some internal standard.  It isn't the collective decisions of democracy that matter _per se_ but how those collective decisions correspond with individual choices.  We see this in utilitarian justifications of democracy where majority voting maximizes the expected utility of voter preferences [@rae1969].  But one needn't be a utilitarian to employ such an approach - @rousseau1920 for example, argued that ==majority rule realises the general will of the people and this gives us reasons value it.==

    !! For Rousseau. Ideally people ought to be governed by the general will. He saw representative government as inferior but necessary – his view was that of the delegate model rather than mandate/representative model, However, since the general will is not so easy to determine, Rousseau  proposed proportional majority rule, rather than simple majority rule, as the best approximation to government by the general will. The larger the proportion the closer to the general will. (see Paul Weirch, (1996). ‘Rousseau on Proportional Majority Rule’, Philosophy and Phenomenology Research, XLVII(1), pp. 111-126. Some writers argue that Rousseau’s theory of the general will is a precursor to pragmatism. The general will is a for m of deliberated upon decision that is warranted.


==Different democracies use different procedures and processes==.  Some democratic processes are deterministic.  People vote according to their belief or preference and the voting procedures employed determines a winning outcome.  This is true for both _naive voting_, where voters believe they alone determine the outcome, as well as _strategic voting_, where voters support a choice other than their sincere preference in an attempt to increase the likelihood of an acceptable outcome [@feddersen1999].  

    !! Expand on this. Which difference democracies and why do they use different procedures and processes?

Other democratic processes however, are indeterministic. This may be because voters themselves don't know how they will vote until the moment they cast their ballot, or because the decision mechanism itself is indeterminate, as in the case of sortition or selection by lottery.  Yet even in these cases, the outcome of a democratic process remains a function of who is included in that process, because changing participants changes the likelihood of particular outcomes.

Even with identical procedures however, who is included in a particular democracy affects the outcomes of that democracy.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, drawing the political line on a map in one location rather than another, will often result in different outcomes than would have otherwise occurred, even for identical democratic procedures.  Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome.  Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different.  In cases of complete consensus, over 50% of voters within a democracy would need to be replaced for the outcome to change.

Both the means for deciding democratic outcomes and the ends that instrumentalist accounts of democracy value can vary considerably.  Democratic processes can be determinate or indeterminate. Outcomes can be judged as content-independent or content-relative.  But they all share one similarity - _who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.  In all cases, for any given democratic procedure, the outcome of that democratic procedure is fully a function of who participates in that process. _Who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.

How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes however, depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.  Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is.  The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are largely arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history.  There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state).  

For each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions).  And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas.  Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.  The variability of possible polities demands specificity.

Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters.  Different borders will produce different results, different results justify different accounts of democracy, therefore different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion.  Content independent justifications of democracy such as Condorcet's or Estlund's, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection.  Condorcet's Jury Theorem for example, requires that there is a better than average chance that any independent voter is correct on some issue.  But even when this is true for some distribution of voters, it is not necessarily true for any partition of voters.

If the epistemic competence of voters (or what ever content-independent criterion underpins the instrumental account of democracy) is tightly clustered, then how the _demos_ is constituted becomes crucially important. Elsewhere [^under-review] [@kinkead2015] I have demonstrated that clustering of the epistemic competence amongst agents in any political space undermines instrumental justifications of democracy when alternative partitions of the space are possible.  

In the figure below, we can see how the epistemic virtue of majority voting in a hypothetical political space - the difference between the underlying epistemic competence of individual agents and that of the majority - is large when agents are uniformly distributed across the space.  As agents become more clustered however (represented here on a scale of 0.0 for no clustering and 1.0 for complete clustering), the epistemic performance of majority voting decreases until there is no difference between majority vote and randomly selecting an individual voter.

This means that when agents or voter competence is uniformly distributed, the question of who the people are is irrelevant for content-independent instrumental justifications of democratic authority.  Any account of inclusion will do.  But when voter competence is not uniformly distributed, the question of who the people are becomes critical.  The more clustered agents or voter competence is, the more necessary a congruent account of inclusion becomes.  When voter competence is highly clustered, only a few accounts of inclusion will be compatible with a content-independent justifications of democracy.  Content-independent justifications of democracy require homogeneity between polities but heterogeneity within them.  Without this characteristic, democracy has no epistemic value.

Content-relative justifications of democracy such as preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous within polities for democratic preference aggregation to have value.  Content-relative justification claim that democracy is the best way to maximise some group relevant criteria like preference or value.  As Figure Two below demonstrates however, these accounts only work when most voters have similar values.  Here, the fidelity of individual to majority preference is high when agents or voter preferences are highly clustered.  Again, any account of inclusion will do.  But when agents or voter preferences are uniformly distributed, then only a few very specific accounts of inclusion will support a content-relative instrumental justification of democratic authority.

Instrumental justifications of democracy require very specific accounts of inclusion.  Depending on the nature of potential _demoi_, actual _demoi_ must be constituted in such a way that they support the claims made by instrumental accounts of democracy.  Because the claims of instrumental accounts only hold true in certain circumstances, all instrumental justifications of democracy must also supply a congruent account of inclusion if the entailment requirement of political justification is to be satisfied.  Failure to do so will mean that any claim regarding the legitimacy of democratic authority will not be warranted.

Yet no instrument justifications of democracy do this.  Some, like Condorcet's Jury Theorem, specific necessary conditions of voter competence that are presumed to be true.  But even if these conditions are satisfied for some conception of the people as a whole, they are not necessarily satisfied for any particular partitions of those people.  This inability to satisfy the presumed conditions become more likely as the clustering of voter competence increases.  Since instrumental accounts of democracy must offer a corresponding account of inclusion, and no instrumental account of democracy does this, instrumental justifications of democracy fail to satisfy the evidentiary requirement of political justification.

This is not to say however, that no instrumental account of democracy could every satisfy these requirements.  New instrumental justification may not succumb to this problem, or appropriate accounts of inclusion may be developed to support existing instrument accounts of democracy.  It is just that no current instrument justification of democracy does this.

The problems for instrument accounts do not end there. Note that these accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion.  Content-independent accounts require accounts of inclusion that realise sufficiently large and internally diverse _demoi_ that are homogeneous externally. These content-independent accounts are strongest with a few similar polities.  Content-relative accounts require the opposite however.  These accounts require corresponding accounts of inclusion that realise sufficiently small and internally homogeneous _demoi_ that are heterogeneous externally.  Individual preferences are best realised by majority voting when citizens have similar preferences.

Given the same distribution of people, preference, and competencies, the requirements of only one instrumental account of democracy can be met. Democracy can be justified on epistemic _or_ preference realisation grounds but not both.  Yet pluralistic instrumental justification of democracy are common in the literature.  Mill justified democracy because it forced representatives to consider the needs of all citizens (content-relative), because it was the most reliable way of reaching the right decision (content-independent), and because it transforms the moral character of those citizens (content-indifferent).  Rousseau offered similar pluralist reasons - democracy realises the general will (content-relative) and tells voters when they are correct (content-independent).  When instrumental justifications of democracy require different, incompatible accounts of inclusion, they themselves become incompatible.  And when they are used together, fail to meet the entailment requirement of political justification.


## Conclusion

Who the people are, and who they should be, is a matter of fundamental important to democratic theory.  How the _demos_ is constituted affects democracy's size, effectiveness, values, identity, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  In Part One, we saw that there are no easy solutions to the Boundary Problem.  The people can't constituted themselves via consent, emergence, or democratic process without the solution becoming trapped in vicious circularity or falling into an infinite regress of who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Descriptive extra-democratic solutions fair no better. Nationality lacks any objective criteria, salience is a matter of perspective, and history is too arbitrary.  The All-Coerced Principle asks the wrong question and the All-Affected Principle, while promising, requires either issue based jurisdictions or a global _demos_, both of which are incompatible with the current Westphalian system of nation-states.

In Part Two, we saw how the different perspectives and projects of democratic theory require different solutions to the Boundary Problem.  The Democrat, concerned with compatibility of accounts of inclusion with substantive democratic values require solutions that are at odds with the Cosmopolitan who is concerned with how the question of _who the people are_ affects substantive cosmopolitan concerns like global justice and fairness.  The Anarchist however, is concerned first and foremost with how any answer to the Boundary Problem affects the legitimacy of democratic authority.

In Part Three, we explored the anarchist concern in more depth and examined how it impacts instrumental justifications of democratic authority.  Different instrumental accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion, different answers to the Boundary Problem, of who the people should be.  No instrumental account does this so all instrumental accounts fail to satisfy the evidentiary requirement of political justification.

These different accounts of inclusion required by instrumentalist justification are incompatible however.  Content-independent accounts of democracy require accounts of inclusion that generate large, internally heterogeneous, and externally homogeneous polities.  Content-relative accounts of democracy by contrast require accounts of inclusion that generate small, internally homogeneous, and externally heterogeneous polities.  Because these underlying accounts of inclusion are incompatible, the instrumentalist accounts of democracy that depend on them are incompatible themselves.  Justifications of democratic authority that combine incompatible instrumentalist accounts therefore fail to satisfy the entailment requirement of political justification.

Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and given the failure of instrumental accounts to offer corresponding accounts of inclusion, it is doubtful that any democratic state could be.  Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the challenges of the Boundary Problem and the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means that extant instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.
