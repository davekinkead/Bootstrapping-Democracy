# The Paradox of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the People of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. [^usa]

> Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania ... have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth ... [^australia]

> ... le peuple français proclame à nouveau que tout être humain, sans distinction de race, de religion ni de croyance, possède des droits inaliénables et sacrés. [^france]

> 日本国民は、... ここに主権が国民に存することを宣言し、この憲法を確定する。[^japan]

The people are the basic unit of any democracy. They are it's _raison d'etre_, the source of it's power, of it's legitimacy, and of it's sovereignty.  As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and justify how they should organise politically.

But who exactly are _the people_? More importantly, who _should_ they be?  Where should we draw our borders and why?  Who gets to vote?  And who should have a say in answering these questions?  Who ought be included in the _demos_ and who ought be excluded has a profound effect on the realisation of justice, the coherence of democratic theory, and the legitimacy of democratic authority.  These questions have collectively become known as the Boundary Problem of democratic theory and answering them properly is of fundamental importance to democracy and the legitimacy of democratic authority.

In [chapter 3], we saw that democracy is sometime justified on procedural grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is constituted according to some appropriate procedure.  But the appropriateness of all procedures is context-dependent.  What is fair or just in one context, or for one group of people, may not be fair or just in another.  Answering the question of who the people ought be one way rather than another can therefore change the appropriateness of the procedure.

Other times, democracy is justified on substantive grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it embodies important values and ideals.  Sometimes these ideals are universal.  Freedom and autonomy for example, seem to be valued by all people in all environments.  Sometimes these ideals are not.  The importance of the family or tribal relations for example, is valued highly in some societies but less so in others.  And even for universal values, their relative importance varies considerably amongst different peoples.  Whether liberty should take priority over equality will depend on who is being asked.  Who the people are will determine which substantive values democracy is to be justified by.

And for others still, democracy is justified on instrumental grounds.  Democratic authority on this account, is legitimate because it is the best way to produce certain valuable ends.  Democracy tracks the truth, it forms the general will, it transforms the moral character of citizens.  Those ends however, are a function of which procedures are used and who participates in those procedures.  They are a function of  who is included amongst _the people_.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the borders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.

--> Size of a democratic people determines both its citizen effectiveness and system capacity (see Dahl 1973 Size & Democracy).

Who the people are affects what democracies do and what democracy is.  Democratic theory, however, is silent on who they people should be.  It can't, because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it. Democratic answers are either viciously circular in that they must first presuppose the answer to the question they ask, or result in an infinite regress of deciding who gets to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide.

Non-democratic solutions however, fair little better.  A number of principles to settle the question - historical accident, nationality, cultural or linguistic salience, the all-coerced principle, and the all-affected principle - have been proposed but none offer an adequate solution. Despite the best efforts of political theorists in the last 30 years, there is a total lack of consensus as to how we might answer the question of who the people should be.  

In the part one of this chapter, I will survey the various attempts to solve the Boundary Problem ...

In part two, I will explore how these different solutions succeed and fail for different projects within democratic theory....

In part three, I will examine how different accounts of democratic inclusion affect different justifications of democracy and show that this proves fatal for instrumental justifications of democratic authority.


## No Good Answers

Before considering the various proposed solutions to the problem of inclusion, it is worth considering why the people can't constitute themselves.  If two or more individuals meet and decide to act as one, why aren't they a _people_?  Cooperation arises in many situations, and large scale social cooperation can emerge even amongst individuals in competition for scares resources [@skrimms].  Why can't political associations arise from emergent behaviour?

There is in fact, no reason that makes this impossible nor impermissible.  There are innumerable instances of voluntary associations, whether they be political parties, churches, or sporting clubs, forming and acting jointly.  In many cases, these organisations have rules and regulation laid down in constitutions that constrain what actions, individually or jointly, are _legitimate_.  

Emergent or _causa sui_ solutions become highly unlikely however, when applied to non-voluntary associations like political states.  In these cases any account of inclusion needs to justify why an individual is a member of one particular people even if they wish to be member of another.  Accounts of democratic inclusion, for Westphalian states at least, must also justify why other individuals should be excluded from one particular people even if they wish to be included amongst them.

If people cannot decide to become a people individually (in the Westphalian sense), then neither can they decide to become a people collectively.  Why shouldn't the solution to the problem of democratic inclusion be a democratic one?  The reason of course, is that any collective action requires a subject, _the people_ in this case, to act collectively.  But if the answer to the question of _who should the people should_ is _whoever the people decide_, then our account of inclusion is question begging - we cannot accept the conclusion without accepting the premises.  We become entangled in a logic of vicious circularity when ever the people asking the question are the same people in the answer.

Yet if the people asking the question are not the same people in the answer, then we have a different but equally intractable problem.  Before we can decide who the people should be democratically, we need to first decide which people will do the deciding.  And in order to decide that matter democratically, we need to identify a prior people to decide who gets to decide who gets to decide _ad infinitum_.  When our answer and questioners are the same people, we become trapped in a loop of circular logic.  When they are different people we stumble into an infinite regress.  An account of democratic inclusion cannot be decided democratically.

The matter cannot be solved democratically.  We must therefore look at _extra democratic_ solutions.  The most common of these, and the one that seems to underpin _actual_ democracies is 


*Territorial States*

The people can be defined by historical accident - those in a state are the people. But this can't solve the boundary problem when territorial issues are in dispute.

> "Democracy can be practiced for making collective decisions once the collectivity has been defined, but democratic methods themselves are inadequate to establish the bounds of the collectivity, whose existence democratic theory simple pre-supposes." [@whelan 
p22]

*Nationality*

Another common criteria for inclusion is nationality.  The people of France should be composed of the French.

Nationality has no objective criteria

Nationality and ethnicity have also been suggested as ways to demarcate the people - the UN recognises the right of self-determination for peoples.  The objections to these are many:

  - "No single objective criterion of nationality appears definitive." [@whelan1983 p29]
  - States govern many nations of people.
  - State determine nations as much as nations determine states ie the Soviet people, the Yugoslavian people.
  - People may wish to align themselves non-ethnically.
  - The nationalist principle is non-voluntaristic. 


*Geography & Salience*

Human distribution seems to drive grouping and connection. Those closest share common ends. Yet...

Physical features are a matter of perspective. Rivers divide as much as unite communities. Mountains are boarders only to those who live on the plains. p37
Economic patterns develop in response to political boundaries, just as much as they form common bonds. p35


These reasons seem to clash with democratic values such s voluntarism, freedom and rationality. [@whelan p31]

A far more promising candidate that has obvious normative appeal is the _All-Coerced Principle_.

> > "being coerced by a demos does generate a claim for inclusion that is far stronger than any claim that the affected interests principle is likely to generate" @miller p225

The all coerced principle answers the wrong question.

Two key principles are the affected-interests and coercion principles.  It's possible to be affected without being coerced but not vice versa. [@miller2009 p214]

*All-Affected Principle* @whelan

Intuitively, all those affected by some policy ought have a voice in making it. (p16) The intuition is clear when burdens are to be imposed but not so clear that those receiving benefits ought have a say in the matter. (p17)

Yet, every decision affects people differently. Constituency would need to be determined on a per issue basis. p19

Deeper still, determining who is affected by an issue requires a prior determination of constituency, which cannot be made by those affected as this is the very question to be settled. p19

All affected principle in incompatible with westphalian states.

Issue based jurisdictions

Who get's to propose

A global demos.

These other principles fail to 'command general respect' [@whelan p40]


## Democrats, Cosmopolitans, & Anarchists

There seem to be no viable solutions to the Boundary Problem.

While some solutions may work for some accounts of democracy, no solution works for all.

The Democrat is primarily concerned with answering the question democratically.  This may relate to the intractability of the Boundary Problem with procedural accounts of democracy, or the conflict of non-democratic solutions with substantive democratic values.

For the Democrat, the problem in the Boundary Problem is that any procedurally democratic solution leads to an infinite regress and founding paradox.  There can be no democracy without a _demos_.  All democratic procedures require the identification of some specified _demos_ by whom any _kratos_ is wielded.  So answering the question of who should be included in the demos democratically first requires the identification of some prior group to decide that questions.  And who should make up this group? Answering that question requires the identification of another prior group _ad infinitum_.

For the proceduralist, the Boundary Problem is a true paradox but not all accounts of democracy are procedural. Democracy however, is much more than just voting or deliberation.  It's also the realisation of substantive ideals such as political equality, popular sovereignty, or even autonomy.  @arrhenius2005 notes the distinction between democratic theories, democratic processes, and democratic values.

> "If we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." @arrhenius2005 p14

Are there any procedurally non-democratic yet substantively democratic ways of identifying a demos?  Perhaps, but as @miller2009 illustrates, different conceptions of democracy promote different, sometimes conflicting substantive values.  Radical Democrats offer a an account of democracy that requires solidarity and group identification while Liberal Democrats conception of democracy require the protection of liberty above all other ideals.

The primacy of liberty however, conflicts with the primacy of solidarity.  One conception values democracy in instrumental terms, the other intrinsically.  And this conflict plays out in how the priority of differing substantive democratic values creates different answers to the Boundary Problem.  Radicals favour inclusionary solutions for different reasons to Liberals - decision quality is higher in diverse groups while diversity limits minority oppression. Likewise, Radical favour exclusionary solutuions for different reasons to Liberals - solidarity is higher in smaller groups while respect for law is only possible with mutual respect and identity. 

So even if Democrats themselves could agree on a solution to the Boundary Problem, would that solution be acceptable to the Cosmopolitan or Anarchist?  While there may be mutually acceptable answers between Radical Democratic and Cosmopolitan, it's unlikely any solution would be acceptable to the Anarchist.  This is because few justifications of democratic authority rely on appeals to substantive democratic ideals for the simple reason that they lack what AJ Simmons calls the _particularity requirement_ - why our allegence is owed to this democratic authority rather than another.


The cosmopolitan's chief concern is whether the answer accords with normative principles that aren't limited to are particular people.  _Ceteris paribus_, humans have equal moral worth regardless of which polity they reside in.  The Cosmopolitan's approach to the Boundary Problem is concerned with the fairness of different groups of being subjected to different political frameworks and the normative question of who should be included and why.  

The cosmopolitan rejects claims to nationalism, culture or the status quo but can answer the question by identifying some universal principle of inclusion: the all affected principle, justice, welfare, autonomy or equality.

For the Cosmopolitan, the problem in the Boundary Problem is that democratic inclusion citizenship is closely tied to these substantive principles.  The Boundary Problem has a profound impact on individual welfare and fairness, and is therefore a challenge to the principles of justice.

Incorrectly bounding the demos means that many people are denied justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.  Incorrectly constituting the people is at offs with the Cosmopolitan's basic substantive ideals.  

### Restorative justice

The actions of some affect others.  The actions of some countries affect others.  The externalities of some states (or members of those states) often result in significant harm to others outside of that state.

Restorative justice requires that those harmed be given some form or recourse to that harm.  Political participation is a form of restorative justice for subjects against the coercive power of the state.  

The Boundary Problem means that many people are denied restorative justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.

@simmons2013 responds that we should bite the bullet and accept that ideal theory can't deal with the boundary problem, but non-ideal theory can claim the pressing matters of distributive justice can counter the ideal problems raised by the Boundary Problem.

    "one simply cannot defend a plausible theory of domestic justice and legitimacy without first identifying the persons and territories that count as rightfully inside and rightfully outside a state’s boundaries of authority." p351


### Distributive justice 

The accidents of history and the biological lottery mean that the initial conditions of our lives, the set of rights, goods, and opportunities available to us at birth and beyond, vary greatly not just between members of our society but between members of societies themselves.

Distributive justice requires that natural, economic, legal, and social resources are distributed fairly. 

Different states and societies have different economic and political frameworks.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals having (significantly) different access to basic resources.

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with distributive justice.


### Procedural justice

_Ceteris paribus_, justice requires that the procedures of the state for resolving disputes and allocating resources be fair between people.  Equal people should be treated equally.

Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals being subjected to (significantly) different rules and frameworks.

Why should someone in Finland be subjected to open and transparent rule of law when their neighbours in Russia are not (if they want it).

The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with procedural justice.

The anarchist is concerned with how any answer affects democracy's ability to legitimate political authority.  I use the label anarchist very loosely, similarly to Simmons' philosophical anarchism - anyone skeptical of political authority.

>  "If existing political boundaries fail to reflect “morally respectable” solutions to the problem of the need for localized justice, why should we take the legitimate territorial jurisdictions of existing states or the genuine political obligations of their claimed subjects to be determined by such a morally tainted process?" 
> 
> -- @simmons2013 p332

### The Anarchist

Many accounts of democracy justify the authority of a democratic state by way of reference to particular outcomes or states of affairs that democratic processes bring about.  A democratic authority might be a legitimate authority because democratic processes track the truth better than others, best promotes the common good, best realise individual preferences in groups or best ensure the needs of all members of society are realised.

Incorrectly bounding the demos undermines some democratic accounts of legitimacy making but not others.  Some solutions to the Boundary Problem are compatible with some accounts of democratic authority, but many are not.  So the anarchist is content with any answer in which the account of democratic inclusion is congruent with the account of democratic authority.

Some solutions to the Boundary Problem are compatible with some accounts of democratic authority, but many are not.  So the anarchist is content with any answer in which the account of democratic inclusion is congruent with the account of democratic authority.  Yet those answers to the Boundary Problem which are congruent with accounts of democracy authority are typcially incompatibale with Cosmopolitan conceptions. 



## Instrumental Failures


We have already seen that common way to justify democratic authority is _instrumentally_.  Instrumental accounts rely on the desirable outcomes that democratic procedures bring about. Democracy, instrumentalists claim, identifies the right answers, produces beneficial consequences, or leads to good policy.  

Sometimes the desirability of these outcomes is judged according to some independent criteria.  According to these accounts, there is some external standard for measuring the quality of a decision.  Epistemic accounts of democracy like Condorcet's Jury Theorem [@condorcet1976] or David Estund's Epistemic Proceduralism [@estlund2009] are like this.  Truth exists independently of our beliefs; democratic processes track the truth; so this gives us reason to value democracy.

Other times, we might judge the quality of democratic outcomes against some agent relative criteria.  Rather than rely on something external, the desirability of a particular result is assessed against some internal standard.  It isn't the collective decisions of democracy that matter _per se_ but how those collective decisions correspond with individual choices.  We see this in utilitarian justifications of democracy where majority voting maximizes the expected utility of voter preferences [@rae1969].  But one needn't be a utilitarian to employ such an approach - @rousseau1920 for example, argued that majority rule realises the general will of the people and this gives us reasons value it.

And for others still, it is not the particular content of democratic decision making that matters so much as the effects that democratic processes have on the participants.  Democracy changes people.  This is what @mill1862 had in mind when he argued that democracy transforms the moral character of its participants.  Democratic participation makes good citizens.  

Different democracies use different procedures and processes.  Some democratic processes are deterministic.  People vote according to their belief or preference and the voting procedures employed determines a winning outcome.  This is true for both _naive voting_, where voters believe they alone determine the outcome, as well as _strategic voting_, where voters support a choice other than their sincere preference in an attempt to increase the likelihood of an acceptable outcome [@feddersen1999].  

Other democratic processes however, are indeterministic. This may be because voters themselves don't know how they will vote until the moment they cast their ballot, or because the decision mechanism itself is indeterminate, as in the case of sortition or selection by lottery.  Yet even in these cases, the outcome of a democratic process remains a function of who is included in that process, because changing participants changes the likelihood of particular outcomes.

Even with identical procedures however, who is included in a particular democracy affects the outcomes of that democracy.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, drawing the political line on a map in one location rather than another, will often result in different outcomes than would have otherwise occurred, even for identical democratic procedures.  Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome.  Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different.  In cases of complete consensus, over 50% of voters within a democracy would need to be replaced for the outcome to change.

Both the means for deciding democratic outcomes and ends that instrumentalist accounts of democracy value vary considerably.  Determinate or indeterminate processes. Content-independent, content-relative, or content-indifferent outcomes.  They all share one similarity however - _who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.  In all cases, for any given democratic procedure, the outcome of that democratic procedure is fully a function of who participates in that process. _Who_ votes determines _what_ is decided.

How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes however, depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.  Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is.  The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history.  There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state).  

And for each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions).  And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas.  Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.

Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters.  Different borders will produce different results, and different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion.  Content independent justifications of democracy like Condorcet's or Estlund's for example, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection.  Without this diversity within polities, democracy has no epistemic value.

Content-relative justifications of democracy like preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous for democratic preference aggregation to have value.  They only work when most voters have similar values (or can at least always work better given some other account of inclusion).  These accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion, and given the same demos, the requirements of of only one account of democracy can be met. As such, any account of democracy that is based on the instrumental value of democratic outputs must also offer a corresponding, and congruent, account of inclusion.  Failure to do so will mean that any claim of democratic authority's legitimacy is not warranted.

The dilemma for democracy is that while these instrumental accounts of democracy require the articulation of a supporting account of inclusion, democratic theory cannot offer any answers to the question of inclusion.  That's because any attempt to answer the question of inclusion - who the people ought be - democratically, results in an infinite regress.  Before we can vote on who gets to vote, we must first vote on who gets to vote for who gets to vote.

Neither can non-democratic accounts of inclusion help.  Many of these lack the sufficient normative to justify inclusion of one group over another.  Accounts of inclusion based on nationality, historic accident, linguistic, economic, or cultural salience are like this.  But accounts of inclusion that are sufficiently normative either lack sufficient specificity or enfranchise too many. The all-coerced principle merely says that anyone subject to a law must be included in the law making processes.  This however only says what is necessary for _any_ political association.  

The all-affected principle says that anyone affected by some law should have a say in the matter.  This results in either a single global demos or issue specific demoi.  A global demos is compatible with content-independent instrumental justifications but content-relative ones.  Overlapping demoi are compatible with content-relative instrumental justifications but not content-independent ones.  And neither are compatible with the current Westphalian system of states.  

Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and it is doubtful that any democratic state could be.  Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.
