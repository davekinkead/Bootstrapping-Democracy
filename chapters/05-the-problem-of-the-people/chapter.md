# The Paradox of the people

The Purpose of this chapter is show that instrumental accounts of democracy cannot satisfy the justificatory requires of political authority.

---

## Introduction

Democracy begins with the people.  Democratic theory simply presupposes them.  They come together, unite as one and declare:

> We the people of the United States ...

> Le peuple français proclame ...

> 日本国民は ...

As both a system of government and political theory, democracy starts with a determinant group of people, _the demos_, and proceeds to explain and attempts to justify how they should organise politically. Yet democratic theory is silent on who they people ought be.  It can't because who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to that of what they do and how they do it.

But who the people are is of fundamental importance to democracy.  Enfranchising some people rather than others, or drawing the boarders of a state in one location rather than another, will typically result in different outcomes for identical democratic procedures.  To demonstrate just how this occurs, consider the following hypothetical:

## Recap

  - we need epistemic warrant to obey content indepedent & preemptive reasons for action
  - that warrant consists of an entailment justification from certain political conditions to authority, as well as sufficient grounds for believing the existence of those conditions.
  - a justification fails when any of those aren't met.

In chapter 2, we examined the conditions of that any justification of political authority


In chapter 3, we saw that many justifications of democratic authority were _instrumental_.
  - instrumental AoD rely on specific outcomes.


## Meat

- why these conditions can't be satisfied.

  - those outcomes are a function of inclusion.
  - different accounts of inclusion will result in different outcomes.
  - so all instrumental AoD must also offer accounts of inclusion.
  - but no instrumental account offers an account of inclusion.
  - what about all the other accounts?
  - show why they also fail
