## Democrats, Cosmopolitans, & Anarchists

    --> There seems to be no clear solution to the Boundary Problem.  Each account of inclusion discussed above offers some ....  

    --> But while some solutions may work for some accounts of democracy, no solution works for all.

    --> Just like there is a diverse range of justifications for democratic authority, there is a diversity in perspectives and projects within political and democratic theory.  In this section, I offers three new perspectives on the Boundary Problem through the eyes of what I call the Democrat, the Cosmopolitan, and the Anarchist[^1]. Different accounts of inclusion may support different democratic perspectives and projects but no single account of inclusion can support them all.  

    **The Democrat**

    - why it can't be answered democratically
    - the conflict of extra-democratic solutions with democratic values

    > The Nationalist doesn't address the issue because relies on a pre-democratic claim to justify the people, which cannot justify democracy. [@agne p385]

    The Democrat is primarily concerned with answering the question democratically.  This may relate to the intractability of the Boundary Problem with procedural accounts of democracy, or the conflict of non-democratic solutions with substantive democratic values.

    For the Democrat, the problem in the Boundary Problem is that any procedurally democratic solution leads to an infinite regress and founding paradox.  There can be no democracy without a _demos_.  All democratic procedures require the identification of some specified _demos_ by whom any _kratos_ is wielded.  So answering the question of who should be included in the demos democratically first requires the identification of some prior group to decide that questions.  And who should make up this group? Answering that question requires the identification of another prior group _ad infinitum_.

    For the proceduralist, the Boundary Problem is a true paradox but not all accounts of democracy are procedural. Democracy however, is much more than just voting or deliberation.  It's also the realisation of substantive ideals such as political equality, popular sovereignty, or even autonomy.  @arrhenius2005 notes the distinction between democratic theories, democratic processes, and democratic values.

    > "If we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." @arrhenius2005 p14

    Are there any procedurally non-democratic yet substantively democratic ways of identifying a demos?  Perhaps, but as @miller2009 illustrates, different conceptions of democracy promote different, sometimes conflicting substantive values.  Radical Democrats offer a an account of democracy that requires solidarity and group identification while Liberal Democrats conception of democracy require the protection of liberty above all other ideals.

    The primacy of liberty however, conflicts with the primacy of solidarity.  One conception values democracy in instrumental terms, the other intrinsically.  And this conflict plays out in how the priority of differing substantive democratic values creates different answers to the Boundary Problem.  Radicals favour inclusionary solutions for different reasons to Liberals - decision quality is higher in diverse groups while diversity limits minority oppression. Likewise, Radical favour exclusionary solutuions for different reasons to Liberals - solidarity is higher in smaller groups while respect for law is only possible with mutual respect and identity. 

    So even if Democrats themselves could agree on a solution to the Boundary Problem, would that solution be acceptable to the Cosmopolitan or Anarchist?  While there may be mutually acceptable answers between Radical Democratic and Cosmopolitan, it's unlikely any solution would be acceptable to the Anarchist.  This is because few justifications of democratic authority rely on appeals to substantive democratic ideals for the simple reason that they lack what AJ Simmons calls the _particularity requirement_ - why our allegence is owed to this democratic authority rather than another.


    **The Cosmopolitan**

    - the conflict of solutions with cosmopolitan values
    - the conflict of cosmo solutions with democratic values

    The cosmopolitan's chief concern is whether the answer accords with normative principles that aren't limited to are particular people.  _Ceteris paribus_, humans have equal moral worth regardless of which polity they reside in.  The Cosmopolitan's approach to the Boundary Problem is concerned with the fairness of different groups of being subjected to different political frameworks and the normative question of who should be included and why.  

    The cosmopolitan rejects claims to nationalism, culture or the status quo but can answer the question by identifying some universal principle of inclusion: the all affected principle, justice, welfare, autonomy or equality.

    For the Cosmopolitan, the problem in the Boundary Problem is that democratic inclusion citizenship is closely tied to these substantive principles.  The Boundary Problem has a profound impact on individual welfare and fairness, and is therefore a challenge to the principles of justice.

    Incorrectly bounding the demos means that many people are denied justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.  Incorrectly constituting the people is at offs with the Cosmopolitan's basic substantive ideals.  

    **Restorative justice**

    The actions of some affect others.  The actions of some countries affect others.  The externalities of some states (or members of those states) often result in significant harm to others outside of that state.

    Restorative justice requires that those harmed be given some form or recourse to that harm.  Political participation is a form of restorative justice for subjects against the coercive power of the state.  

    The Boundary Problem means that many people are denied restorative justice when the actions of one state (or members of that state) adversely impact by denying them any political recourse.

    @simmons2013 responds that we should bite the bullet and accept that ideal theory can't deal with the boundary problem, but non-ideal theory can claim the pressing matters of distributive justice can counter the ideal problems raised by the Boundary Problem.

        "one simply cannot defend a plausible theory of domestic justice and legitimacy without first identifying the persons and territories that count as rightfully inside and rightfully outside a state’s boundaries of authority." p351


    **Distributive justice**

    The accidents of history and the biological lottery mean that the initial conditions of our lives, the set of rights, goods, and opportunities available to us at birth and beyond, vary greatly not just between members of our society but between members of societies themselves.

    Distributive justice requires that natural, economic, legal, and social resources are distributed fairly. 

    Different states and societies have different economic and political frameworks.

    Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals having (significantly) different access to basic resources.

    The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with distributive justice.


    **Procedural justice**

    _Ceteris paribus_, justice requires that the procedures of the state for resolving disputes and allocating resources be fair between people.  Equal people should be treated equally.

    Inclusion in one people vs another results in individuals being subjected to (significantly) different rules and frameworks.

    Why should someone in Finland be subjected to open and transparent rule of law when their neighbours in Russia are not (if they want it).

    The grounds for inclusion is rarely one that can be considered fair (accidents of history) and thus conflicts with procedural justice.

    The anarchist is concerned with how any answer affects democracy's ability to legitimate political authority.  I use the label anarchist very loosely, similarly to Simmons' philosophical anarchism - anyone skeptical of political authority.

    **The Anarchist**

    - challenges vs illegitimacy
    - how instrumental accounts are fatally undermined
