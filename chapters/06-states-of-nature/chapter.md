# Games of Thrown

## Modelling Hobbes' Leviathan

## Introduction

Leviathan

Many theorists have attempted to model Hobbes' account in a game theoretical mannor.

This chapter attempts to investigate whether Hobbes' conclusion is entailed under a charitable reading and if not, what in his theory would need to change.


## Hobbes & Game Theory

Hobbes has been described as the proto-game theorist (by who?).  And it's easy to see why.  (explain).

There is now a large body of work applying game theory to Hobbes [Footnote who].  Yet there is considerable disagreement on how exactly, Leviathan should be modelled.

Review who has applied game theory and how.

What is the source of the disagreement?

  1. interpretation of the text
  2. methodological constraints

I will avoid the debate in by modelling multiple games.  I will overcome 2 by using an agent based approach


## Leviathan

Outline Hobbes argument.  Bring in support from secondary sources.  Justify my interpretation.

  1. Peace is only possible with an absolute soveriegn
  2. It is rational to desire peace
  3. Therefore it is rational to submit to an absolute soveriegn


In the state of nature

  1. Everyone is motiviated for self-preservation (its a natural right)
  2. Competition for scare resources creates conflict 'a state of diffidence'
  3. The only way to secure these resources is by acquiring more
  4. Some are instrinsically motiviated by power as well
  5. The result is a state of war of all against all.

Only absolute power works


## Modelling Leviathan

It is clear that there are two distinct arguments:

  - the source of war
  - the solution to war

As @eggers notes, much of the literature focuses on only one, or conflates the two.  Examples.

What we need to do then is model both, and perhaps combine them.

One reason this hasn't been done is that it is very difficult using analytic game theory. It's too complex.

An agent based approach can overcome this.

Build a basic model here.

## States of Nature

The purpose of this is to determine if Hobbes' conclusion is entailed.  Under which interpretations of Hobbes does the state of nature lead to _bellum omnina contra ommes_.
