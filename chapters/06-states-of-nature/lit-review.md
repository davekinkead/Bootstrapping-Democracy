> Iterated PD.

> The familiar problem of whether Hobbesian men in the state of nature would ever abide by an agreement to obey a Sovereign is a version of the puzzle now known as‘Prisoner's Dilemma'. The present paper has the following aims: (1) To establish that the game-theory approach is a legitimate way to study Hobbes. (2) To see whether a proposed 'solution’to the paradox of Prisoner's Dilemma applies to this example. The paradox is that individually rational self-interested calculations sum to an outcome that is suboptimal not only for society but also for every single member of it. The solution is the Supergame which consists of indefinitely repeated plays of the simple Prisoner's Dilemma game. (3) To compare the results of the above with the similar conclusions reached by a different route by recent arguments in sociobiology.

> Arguably, then, Leviathan is not so much an account of the origins of obligation as a warning against overthrowing extant sovereignty. p341

> The alternative approach starts from the observation that Hobbes’s solution to the Social Contract game is clearly dynamic, not static: p342

> I propose to call it ‘Hobbesian anarchism’. p342

Some objections to the iterated game.

  - last game paradox p343
  - very high discount rate p344
  - n > 2 person games p344
  - beggar-thy-neighbour (zero sum games) p345

> If the game is pure beggar-my-neighbour, then it is zero-sum and no Co-operative outcomes are possible p345 ie for positional goods like relative status.

> Hobbes names Competition, Diffidence and Glory as the ‘three principal1 causes of quarrell’ that make the state of nature a state of war p345

> Rational self-interested Co-operators would not need Leviathan or any other enforcing agency: they would all obey the Laws of Nature out of enlightened self-interest. However, the anarchist solution is precarious. It depends on the players’ all having sufficiently low discount rates and on there being enough-just enough-Co-operators in the society to sustain co- operation. p346

> Retaliators do not do better than Hawks if some animals are bigger and stronger than others, and know that they are. In that event, the co-operative equilibrium could not arise anarchistially. p350

Thinks game theorists have strayed too far from Hobbes' claims before developing his own.

> the permanently unsatisfied desire for power is the key to understanding why me compete for resources....Hobbes does not imply that the resources are insufficient for the sustainence of the population, were they divided equally, but they are necessarily insufficient for the satisfaction of everyone's unceasing drive to increase one's instrumental power. p6

Glory seeking is a natural endeavour of every man. p7

> To be undervalued is dangerous for one's security, because other people are more inclined to attack. p7



The introduction of eminence into an assurance game transforms it into a type of PD. p18

> Modelling it as an assurance game with glory overcomes the obsticals raised by other accounts. p20

> We repeat most emphatically that our theory is thoroughly static. A dynamic theory would unquestionably be more complete and therefore preferable. But there is ample evidence from other branches of science that it is futile to try to build one as long as the static side is not thoroughly understood. (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1953, p. 44)

> The inability to model the dynamical element of game play in traditional game theory, and the extent to which evolutionary game theory naturally incorporates dynamical considerations, reveals an important virtue of evolutionary game theory. (SEP)

> These models may also be viewed as modules that, once evolved, may be put together to form more complex interactions. Evolutionary games may be studied from a both a static and dynamic point of view. Static analysis of equilibria reveals a lot about the structure of the interaction, and it can be carried out at a level of generality that does not commit one to a particular dynamics. But dynamic analysis sometimes reveals complexities that are not immediately apparent from the study of equilibria. Dynamic analyses may be mathematically challenging. Computer simulations are always available as a tool, but in these simple game-theoretic models, analytic methods are also applicable.  http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1518/771.short

- evolutonary models can deal with limited or bounded rationality of agent where as traditional static utility base game theory cannot.
