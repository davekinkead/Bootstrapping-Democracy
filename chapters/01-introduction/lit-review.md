> Timothy Williamson (2007) holds that one may learn that a counterfactual conditional is true by robustly obtaining its consequent when using imagination to simulate cases in which its antecedent is true.

> The philosophy of simulation examines the conceptual foundations of simulation.  It explains the nature of simulation and describes the philosophical implications of simulations. p21

> In a typical case, a computer program simulates a mathematical model of a natural system. p22

> Simulations may be classified according to their characteristics.
  - computer vs physical
  - discrete vs continuous
  - purpose
  - simulate reality or theory

> Simulations rest on models ... while it is uncontroversial that models are important and possibly constitutive ele- ments of simulations, it is less clear whether simulations themselves can be treated as models p23

> models perform functions that they could not perform if they were a part of, or strongly dependent on, theories. p24

> models are also distinct from the real world p24

> Models are thus located somewhere in between theory and real world and are often ascribed a mediating role between the two. p24

Models need to match their targets

> Typical views of this relation posit that a model and its target have to be isomorphic (Suppes, 2002; van Fraassen, 1980) or partially isomorphic (Da Costa & French, 2003) to each other. p24

>  Simulations in their construc- tion are autonomous in the sense that they are not merely put together from theory and in that they function as investigative tools independently from theories p24

Models are static, simulations are dynamic.

> This dynamic aspect is often not included when people speak about the underlying model.  p25

Models are typically analytic

> Being able to write down the solution this way makes one absolutely sure how the model will behave under any circumstance. This is called the analytic solution. p26

> For more complex models, the math becomes much too complicated. Instead, the model can be “solved” by simulation.  p26

> To summarize, simulations are, like models, autonomous both from theories and from the real world. They differ from models mainly in their temporal expansion (and sometimes also in their representation of a temporal process) as well as in their epis- temic opacity. p26

> However, the legitimacy of a computer simulation still relies on the analytic understanding of at least the underlying mathematical equations, if not the computation process itself. p26

> the experimental approach to simulations consists in a strategic move to “black- box” (Dowling, 1999, p. 265) the known program and to interact “experimentally” with the surface of the simulation. p26

> Parker (2009) contradicts these claims. She points out that the use of simulations in what she calls “computer simulation studies” involves intervention, just as laboratory experiments do. Computer simulation studies intervene on a material system, namely, the programmed computer. Such studies are thus material experiments in a straightfor- ward sense. p27

Monte Carlo - Simulation vs calculation

> Monte Carlo simulations, as this example shows, are methods of calculation. The stochastic properties of this construct are then used to compute an approximation of the relevant property of the deterministic system.  In other words, the probabilistic analogy does not serve as a representation of the deterministic system. p30

> It is this lack of “mimetic characteristic” (Hughes, 1999, p. 130), the purpose of “imitating another process” (Hartmann, 1996, p. 83), that distinguishes computations like the Monte Carlo approach from imitating simulations.

Analytic vs Simulation

> What is of interest, however, is that such an analytic treatment does not give a sufficient characterization of the replicator dynamics. For example, it does not tell us anything about the paths that the system takes through state space and the speed with which it converges (if at all) to the stable points. For these characterizations, the equations have to be numerically solved (i.e., simulated), and many solution runs compared with each other. This yields a state-space diagram, in which each line describes the path of the system during one simulation run. p32

> Simulations represent by exemplifying structural features of natural systems. If a simulation and a natural system share structural prop- erties, results in the simulation also represent phenomena in the natural system that depend on those structural properties. p32

Agent based

> Instead of simulating the sys- tem’s dynamics by numerically calculating the equations that describe the system’s dynamics, ABS generate the system’s dynamics by calculating the dynamics of the system’s constituent parts and aggregating these dynamics into the system dynamics. p32

> What sets CA and ABS apart is that they model interactions between autonomous cells or agents, thus including a level of complexity not existent in equation-based models. p33

> These emer- gent patterns in computer simulations form the basis for what Mark Bedau (1997) has characterized as “weak emergence.” Traditional modeling techniques will not gener- ate them from the agent base. They can only be arrived at by simulation. p34



  > Paul Humphreys (1991, p. 500) defined simulation as “any computer-implemented method for exploring the properties of mathematical models where analytic methods are not available.” 

  > A simulation imitates one process by another process. In this definition the term “process” refers solely to some object or system whose state changes in time. If the simulation is run on a computer, it is called a computer simulation. (Hartmann 1996 p. 83)

  > System S provides a core simulation of an object or process B just in case S is a concrete computational device that produces, via a temporal process, solutions to a computational model . . . that correctly represents B, either dynamically or statically. If in addition the computational model used by S correctly represents the structure of the real system R, then S provides a core simulation of system R with respect to B. (Humphreys 2014 p. 110)


  > Models are independent from theory, both in their construc- tion and their functioning (Morgan & Morrison, 1999).

  > Winsberg (2009) denies, pace Morgan, that experiments are epistemically privileged, but insists that the knowledge needed for a good simulation is different from the knowledge needed for a good experiment.



Frigg and Reiss (2009)

  1. Metaphysical: Simulations create some kind of parallel world in which experiments can be conducted under more favorable conditions than in the “real world.”

  2. Epistemic: Simulations demand a new epistemology.
  
  3. Semantic: Simulations demand a new analysis of how models/theories relate
to concrete phenomena.
  
  4. Methodological: Simulating is a sui generis activity that lies “in between”
theorizing and experimentation.
