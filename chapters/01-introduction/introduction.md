# Introduction

Bam! A powerful introductory paragraph.

Now raise a problem. 

Traditional political philosophy cant solve this because of methodological limitations.

But there's another way. Simulation.  That's what this thesis is about. Using computational approaches to solve problems in political philosophy.

I'm going to defend the thesis that simulation has a great deal to offer political philosophy.

How does simulation do this?
