# Democracy and Justification

Democracy is the preeminent form of political association in our times.  Of the 196 states recognised by the United Nations, 106 can be classified in some way as democratic [@democracyindex].  Compared with other forms of political authority present today - autocracies, theocracies, monarchies, oligarchies, and anocracies - democracies outnumber all other forms for rule combined.  This represents a vast increase from the mid 20th century, when the rising tide of fascism and totalitarianism resulted in the number of democratic states numbering less than X [cite]. 

Given such a meteoric rise in the transition to democratic rule, and especially so since the fall of the Berlin Wall, one might expect that reasons for this would be clear enough; that the justifications of democratic rule would would warrant wide consensus; or that debate concerning the nature of democratic legitimacy might be largely settled.  Ask the lady on the street, or the man on the Clapham omnibus if would they prefer their leaders to be elected by the people, chosen by bloodline, selected by divine signal, or emerge from bloodshed and competition, and the answer will almost always favour democracy.

Yet even a cursory survey of political thought reveals that justifications of democracy are anything but widely accepted.  The vast literature of Democratic theory proposes a wide and divergent range of accounts attempting to explain the authority of democratic regimes and our obligations as citizens to them.  For some, democracy is an epistemic process - a form of collective decision making that enables people to better make the right decision, or at least improve the long term prospects for superior outcomes.  For others democracy is a transformative mechanism, improving the moral character of its participants and building the solidarity of the state.  For others still, democracy is the only way to realise substantive political ideas - a form of collective self government derived from our natural right to freedom and liberty, a fair and just way of promoting the equal self interest of all members of society.  

Rarely however do proponents of these various accounts seem to agree.  Deep frictions exist between proceduralist and instrumentalists, deliberativists and social choice theorists.  While some justifications of democracy are pluralist, compatible in their approach with others, the majority of democratic accounts are monist in nature, and their foundational values and approaches are in conflict with others.  I find this diversity of accounts and lack of consensus between theorists terribly odd; more strikingly so because of the wide popular support for democracy in general.  Surely, if a coherent justification of democratic authority exists, not only would it have been identified and articulated by now, but wouldn't there also be broad agreement of it relative strengths and merits?

Of course an absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of an absence [^bayesian]. One might object that the fact we don't seem to broadly agree that one particular account of democracy or another is sufficiently coherent to adequate justify the coercive force of the state, is not by itself enough to to support the claim that such a coherent account does not exist.  An objector might simply point to the field of linguistics where no universal theory of grammar yet exists, nor any formal grammar that fully describes a natural language.  Yet an incorrect sentence is immediately recognisable to any competent language user.  Why should justifications of democracy be any different in this regard? 

Grammars do exists, even if we are unable to fully explain or describe them.  Our intuitions about the existence of a coherent justification of democratic authority are not nearly as strong. It is simply a matter of empiric fact that any competent speaker of English can recognise the sentence _colourless green ideas sleep furiously_ as grammatically correct but semantically meaningless.  The same cannot be said about Condorcet's Jury Theorem or Estlund's Epistemic Proceduralism.

A more relevant objection however might highlight the similarities with moral theory.

We have strong moral intuitions and wide spread agreement on what is right and wrong.  This is not the case with accounts of democratic authority.






[^bayesian]: I'll ignore the Bayesian perspective for the time being and consider this from a purely modal perspective for now.
