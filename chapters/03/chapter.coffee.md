# Philosophy & Simulation

A review of how simulation has been used in philosophy

### Outline

1. Review simulations place in analytic methodology
2. Get specific about a definition of simulation
2. Lit review of how simulation has been used in philosophy
3. Identify the key strengths of simulation
4. Identify the key weaknesses

1. Review how simulation has been used, its stengths, and its weaknesses
2. Digital Philosophy - examine, and define (non-essential use of computers)
3. Computational Philosophy - essential use of computers


Computational approaches have a great deal to offer philosophy - especially social philosophy.

  - quickly define computational philosophy & simulation

Simulation offers insight in areas that traditional analytic and empiric appraches struggle.

  - complexity and analytically intractable problems
  - experiment better by isolating variables and rerunning one-off events
  - emergence and discoverability

But there are also limits to what simulation can do

  - claims about reality are only as good as a simulations fidelity to reality
  - address the "its not new knowledge" claim

Simulation is still philosophy

  - philosophy has always done thought experiments - history
  - thought experiments are like simulation
  - so simulation is very much philosophy

## Digital Philosophy

While we have so far explored how simulation has been used as a philosophical method, this is not the only way computers can be used.

Philosophy can be produced digitally...

  - wordprocessing
  - collaboratively

Philosophy can be distributed digitally...

  - Online Journals
  - SEP

Philosophy can be consumed digitially...

These are all examlpes of digital philosophy but that doesn't make them computational philosophy..

Define terms _digital_ and _computational_ as the non-essential and essential use of computers in philosophical investigation.
