The Boundary Problem of Democratic Theory
=========================================

My thesis explores normative justifications of suffrage and in particular, seeks to solve the boundary problem in democratic theory, which is to say:

	How can you democratically answer the question of who can vote on a particular issue without first presupposing who can vote on the issue of who can vote?

The boundary problem arises whenever we examine who ought be allowed to vote.  Historically, the issue has been ignored and just who 'the people' are simple taken for granted.

The boundary problem can be thus formulated as:

1. Democratic theory makes claims of legitimacy.  Specifically, democratic theory claims that political authority is legitimate just because (and often only because) that political authority is legitimate.

2. A necessary condition of legitimacy is that outcomes are both not arbitrary and determined by the processes that grounds the legitimacy. 

3. Democratic theory can't answer the normative question of who ought be allowed to vote.  Attempting to do so results in an infinite regress of who gets to vote on who gets to vote on who gets to vote onâ€¦.

4. Yet the determination of who 'the people' are typically predetermines the outcome of any decision.  This is most obvious in cases of succession but also arises whenever the issue of suffrage is open - eg. gerrymander, redistribution or any normative analysis of inclusion.

5. But all existing solutions to the boundary problem - nation, culture, geography, salience, all-affected, & consent - have failed this test.  Democratic theory cannot therefore, claim that its political authority is legitimate.
