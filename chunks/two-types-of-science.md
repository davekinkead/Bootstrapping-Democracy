# Two Types of Science

There are two archetypes of scholarship in science.  In one, scientists observe the world, formulate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and measure results.  When they are done they share their findings in a paper by describing their methodology, reporting their results, before arguing why this evidence better supports one theory over another.  Call this the scholarship of experimental science. 

In another, scientists build theories, construct models, and argue in a paper why one theory is more coherent than another.  Call this the scholarship of theoretical science.

These archetypes are extremes on a scale rather than dichotomies.  Actual scientific scholarship tends to be more one type than the other, yet these archetypes have been widely described for centuries.  And while both forms of scholarship are use argument to establish the warrant of their thesis, the epistemological foundations of their arguments are distinct.

Experimental scholarship reports results and uses argument to show what does or does not follow from them. The epistemological source of the premises is testimonial.  Short of reproducing the experiment themselves, there is no way to independently verify those claims.  The audience of experimental scholarship must _trust_ that the scientist is both honest and accurate.

Theoretical scholarship does not face this challenge.  The theoretical scientist is free to simply begin with widely accepted beliefs and argue from there.   We don't need to place our trust in the theoretical scientist's honesty because we already accept (or can easily verify) the premises.  We don't need to place our trust in the theoretical scientist's accuracy because we can read the argument for ourselves.  All we the audience needs do is evaluate the quality of the warrant. 

The use of computer simulation in science over the last 50 years appears to blend the epistemological characterises of these two archetypes.  On one hand, simulations are purely deductive or probabilistic affairs -- conditions and behaviour of the desiderata are defined gesticulatively, the results of what follows from these stipulations are examined.

On the other hand, the results of computer simulation often have the appearance of experiment -- empiric-like data is generated from the simulated 'experiments' and analysed like any other experiment.

The scholarship of computational science, however, clearly fits the archetype of experimental scholarship.  Simulations generate results, these results are reported, and then form the premises of arguments to show why one theory is more plausible than another.  The epistemological foundations of computational scholarship in science remains testimonial.  We must still trust that the computational scientist is both honest and accurate.

While modern science and philosophy share many epistemological features and a common lineage, a clear methodological difference is that philosophy stands firmly in the theoretical camp (experimental philosophy not withstanding).  Philosophy may (and should) be informed by empirical science but it is first and foremost, a way of generating knowledge via argument.  Most importantly, argument in philosophy begins from premises whose truth is established independently from the argument being offered.  It is the epistemological independence of the premises that clearly distinguishes philosophy from experimental science.

Yet since computation and computer simulation have begun to be used in philosophy, the scholarship of computational philosophy mirrors that of experimental science. Philosophers observe the world, formulate hypotheses, run a computer simulation, and measure results.  When they are done they share their findings in a paper by describing their model (but rarely their code), and reporting their results before arguing why this evidence better supports one theory over another. 

The epistemological source of the premises in the arguments in computational philosophy remains testimonial.

Simulation as testimony presents many of the same challenges that experiment as testimony does.  As the basis of argument, the ....


why this is bad
  - trust in honesty (minor problem)
  - trust in accuracy (not minor problem)
  - extra bad in simulation (no real constraints, high sensitivity to implementation)

why this is very bad for philosophy 
  - the crux of many issues is in the simulation
  - this should therefore be fundamental part of the argument, not a footnote to it
