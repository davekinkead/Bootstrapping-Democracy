Cosmopolitanism and Sovereignty
===============================

Thomas Pogge 1992

3 elements are shared by all cosmopolitan positions: (p48)

- individualism, the ultimate units of concern are human beings,
- universality, the ultimate unit of concern is directed to all people equally,
- generality, this special status has global force.

Cosmopolitanism can be contrasted as: (p49)

- legal, committed to a concrete political global order,
- moral, all persons stand in moral relations to one another.

The central idea of moral cosmopolitanism is that every human being has global stature as an ultimate unit of moral concern. (p49)

Moral cosmopolitanism can be further divided into: (p50)

- institutional conceptions concerning fundamental principles of justice.
	- directs responsibilities to institutional schemes.
	- impose constraints upon shared practices.
	- responsibility extends to the bounds of institutional affect.
- interactional conceptions concerning fundamental principles of ethics.
	- direct responsibility for the fulfilment of human rights to others (both individuals and groups)
	- impose constraints on conduct.
	- responsibility extends to those we interact with.

If we only accept and institutional conception of human rights, then we need some additional moral conception if we wish to deny that anything goes in a state of nature. (p51)

I have a duty to all not to support unjust institutional schemes, even when institutional schemes only impose duties on other participants. (p51)  Contrast this with libertarianism in which we may ignore harms we do not directly bring about.

"If they are not making reasonable efforts towards institutional reform, the more privileged participants in an institutional scheme in which [harm is imposed on the less privileged] are here seen as cooperating in violation of a negative duty." (p52)

"Once one is a participant in social practices, it may no longer be true that one's negative duties require merely forbearance." (p52)

We are asked to be concerned about human rights violations not simply because they occur but because they are the result of practices of which we are participants. (p52)

The only way this moral obligation can be limited to national boarders is if those boarders are natural, god given or fixed a priori (p53)

We consider the existing global institutional scheme unjust insofar as the pattern of human rights fulfilment it tend to produce is inferior to the patter of its best feasible alternatives would produce. (p54)

The issue of distributive justices is no longer about how to distribute a pool of resources, but rather how to design the economic ground rules which regulate production. (p56)

There is an injustice in our current economic scheme which is wrong for affluent participants to perpetuate.  This is so independent of whether we and the starving are united by some common bond just as murder is wrong irrespective of such considerations. (p56)

On Sovereignty
-------------

A is sovereign over B iff: (p57)

1. A is a governmental body or officer ('agency'), and
2. B are persons, and
3. A has unsupervised and irrevocable authority over B
	1. to lay down rules constraining their conduct, or
	2. to judge their compliance with rules, or
	3. to enforce rules against them, or
	4. to act on their behalf vis-a-vis other agencies or persons

A has absolute sovereignty over B off:

1. A is sovereign over B, 
2. no other agency has any authority over A or over B which is not supervised and revokable by A.



Pogge's argument against states having moral claims or considerations (cf Walzer 'Just & Unjust Wars'): "Why do we not also take into account the moral claims of Catholiscism, art, or baseball?" (p74)
