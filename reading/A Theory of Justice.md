# A Theory of Justice

** John Rawls, 1999, Revised Edition ***

## CH1

p3

- The primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society. 
- Justice is the first virtue of social institutions. 
- Laws must be abolished if they are unjust.
- Justice denies the lost of freedom by some can be made up for by benefits to others.

p4 

- the only justification for injustice is the avoidance of a greater one.
- assumes society to be more or less self sufficient.
- a well ordered society is one in which the good of its members is advanced, and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice

p5

- the public sense of justice makes association possible
- the public conception of justice constitutes the fundamental charter of a well ordered society

p6

- society, as a scheme of social cooperation must be stable
- primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society, the major institutions that distribute fundamental rights and duties, and determine the division of advantages that stem from social cooperation

p7

- institutions of society favour certain starting positions, there are deep inequalities.
p8

- its an ideal theory but this is the only way to get a systemic grasp on the issue.
- it is not clear which institutions should be included.
- the concept of social justice provides a standard to assess the distributive aspects of society

p9

- "The concept of justice I take to be defined, then, by the role of its principle in assigning rights and duties and in defining the appropriate division of social advantages." 

p10 

- "these are principles that free and rational persons concerned with furthering their own interest would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association".
- this is what "justice as fairness" means

p11

- the original position is "a purely hypothetical situation characterised so as to lead to a certain conception of justice"
- the principles of which are chosen behind a veil of ignorance, which results in a fair agreement or bargain
- this is what makes the principles of justice fair.

p12

- no society can be voluntary in a literal sense.
- justice as fairness comes as close as possible to a voluntary society
- it models agents as "rational and mutually disinterested"

p13

- "a rational man would not accept a basic structure merely because it maximised the algebraic sum of advantages irrespective of its permanent effects on his own basic rights and interest".
- the intuitive idea is that no one could have a satisfactory life unless the division of advantages was made in such as everyone one willingly took part.

p14

- justice as fairness comprised 2 parts, 1) the initial condition and 2) what principles arise from that.
- the question is not whether to enter a particular scheme, but to identify and accept certain moral principles.
