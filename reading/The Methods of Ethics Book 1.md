# The Methods of Ethics

## Book 1

Ethics is the rational process of determining what individual's 'ought' do.  It is distinguished from politics by its focus on individual rather than collective behaviour, and from science by its normative rather than descriptive focus. p1

Sidgwick characterises ethics as the pursuit of what is right, as if this has some objective, ontological status just waiting to be discovered. p4

Hypothetical imperatives are not sufficient to explain the notion of 'ought', ie we ought value happiness makes no reference to some further end. p7

The choice of ultimate ends determines ethical system require to entail them. p8

Sidgwick identifies happiness (general hedonism/utilitarianism) along with excellence (deontology) as ultimate ends but provides little justification for their exclusive selection. p9
