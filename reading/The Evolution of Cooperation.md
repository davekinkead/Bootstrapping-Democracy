# The Evolution of Cooperation

Robert Axelrod 1981

Axelrod's question for investigation is "under what conditions will cooperation emerge in a world of egoists without central authority?"
p3

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

A situation where what is best for each person individually leads to mutual defection, whereas everyone would have been better off with mutual cooperation. p9.

	Formally, it occurs when both players face T > R > P S.  (T)emptation to defect, (R)eward for mutual cooperation, (P)unishment for mutual defection, (S)uckers payoff for cooperating with a defector.

Actual payoffs and their symmetry between players don't matter as long as the inequality holds. 

In a finite series of games, the best individual strategy is to defect.  With indefinite iteration however, "no best rule exists independently of the strategy being used by the other player" p14  

Which strategy works best depends on whether the other player's strategy leaves room for cooperation.

"the very possibility of achieving stable mutual cooperation depends upon there being a food change of a continuing interaction, as measured by the magnitude of _w_" p16

The discount factor _w_ of future rewards _R_ is 1/(1-w)

Iterative tournaments show that "cooperation can indeed emerge in a world of egoists without central authority" p20

## Tit for Tat

Tit for Tat (reciprocate immediate) was the most effective strategy. p20 

Its success was a combination of being nice, retaliatory, forgiving and clear. p54

"While it pays to be nice, it also pays to be retaliatory" p46

Tit for Tat is _collectively stable_ meaning no other strategy can invade it if _w_ is sufficiently large. p56

For a cooperative strategy to be stable, it must somehow make it unprofitable for a challenger to exploit it. p62

A world of mean strategies (such as All D) cannot be invaded by a single cooperative strategy, but can if the new strategy arrives in a cluster. p63

"A strategy is _maximally discriminating_ if it will eventually cooperate even if the other has never cooperated yet, and once it cooperates, will never cooperate again with All D but will always cooperate with another player using the same strategy as it". p66

Advantage of cooperative strategies against a mix of others is:

	Rc * p + Rd * p (1 - p)  Rc - discounted reward for cooperation, Rd - discounted reward for defection, p - proportion of cooperative players.

If a nice strategy cannot be invaded by a single meanie, it cannot be invaded by a cluster of meanies. p67

Cooperation can emerge in a world of unconditional defectors provided a cluster of cooperation can get a foothold. p68
