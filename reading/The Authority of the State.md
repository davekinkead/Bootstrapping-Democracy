# The Authority of the State

Leslie Green 1990

The defining characteristic of the state is that it claims supreme authority over its subjects.
- "All modern states claim authority over their citizens and that is one thing that distinguishes them from bands of robbers" p1

Legitimacy is not a necessary condition for the existence of the state.

Just rule is a necessary but not sufficient condition for authority.
- "A state is legitimate only if, all things considered, its rule is morally justified" p5

The exercise of authority is the mean to which states achieve their objectives. Its value is conditional upon the justice of those ends. p5

Our inability to bind ourselves to unjust actions is insufficient to explain the nature of contracts in general. p8

Defines a _social relations_ perspective which values not just the form of social order but the way it is achieved. p10

Political authority is necessary for societies because of distribution problems that the market or custom cannot achieve. The state is thus required to _authoritatively allocate_ values. p11

__Two concepts of authority__ p14

1.	A has authority over B iff B regularly complies with A's requirements.
2.	A has authority over B iff A's requirement that B ø forms a premise for B's ø-ing without B considering the merits of acting as A requires

Green supports the latter view noting that an order: p19

	"is accepted as binding only if it forms a premise for the subject's action without his considering the merits of what it requires." 

## The Nature of Authority	

A complete theory of the state needs to include an account of what it is for the state to exist as a differentiated form of social order, and explain the social characteristics that distinguish it. p21

The question of justifying authority can only arise if there is an authority to justify. p22

Appeals to authority are alternatives to appeals to reason.  They seeks to generate additional reasons to act. p26

Authority can be distinguished from advice (practical vs theoretical authority) via the intention of its proclamations and reactions to non-compliance. p26

"Expert advice gives seasons for belief, not action" p27

We are in no way bound to follow the advice of experts, only those in authority. p27

Authority relations are always triadic: A has authority over B in relation to matters C. p28

"Authoritative injunctions are purported to be categorical, to bind. But that does not entail that authority must be absolute" p29

"Authority bunds us to act even when we disagree with its requirements." p32

Authorities issue content independent reasons to act.  We can act contrary to the _balance of reasons_ without acting _contrary to reason._ p37

Authority is exclusionary. It's commands exclude other balance of reason calculations. p38

"Commands claim to be reasons for acting, not merely indications that there are other, and better, reasons for acting" p41

__Green's Def of Authority__ p41--42

	A has authority over B iff the fact that A requires B to ø gives B a content independent reason to ø, and excludes some of B's reasons for not ø-ing.

The institutional nature of authority is non-essential.  Institutions use, rather than explain, authority. p44

Generality is not an essential element of authority because one could have authority over another for a single discrete action (eg pushing a button) p51

_But a problem remains: If authoritative orders give content independent reasons for actions, but the scope of authority can be limited requiring content dependence, then aren't these orders just proxies for other reasons?_

"The correct identification of a person as having authority over others depends only on certain facts about the practical reasoning of those who make or accept such claims" p59
