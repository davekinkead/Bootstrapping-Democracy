# The Authority of the State

Leslie Green 1990

The defining characteristic of the state is that it claims supreme authority over its subjects.
- "All modern states claim authority over their citizens and that is one thing that distinguishes them from bands of robbers" p1

Legitimacy is not a necessary condition for the existence of the state.

Just rule is a necessary but not sufficient conditon for authority.
- "A state is legitimate only if, all things considered, its rule is morally justified" p5

The exercise of authority is the mean to which states acheive their objectives. Its value is conditional upon the justice of those ends. p5

Our inability to bind ourselves to unjust actions is insufficient to explain the nature of countracts in general. p8

Defines a _social relations_ perspective which values not just the form of social order but the way it is acheived. p10

Political authority is necessary for societies because of disrtibution problems that the market or custom cannot achieve. The state is thus required to _authoritarivaly allowcate_ values. p11

__Two concepts of authority__ p14

1.	A has authority over B iff B regularly complies with A's requirements.
2.	A has authority over B iff A's requirement that B ø forms a premise for B's ø-ing without B considering the merits of acting as A requires

Green supports the latter view noting that an order: p19

	"is accepted as binding only if it forms a premise for the subject's action without his considering the merits of what it requires."
