# The Authority of the State

Leslie Green 1990

The defining characteristic of the state is that it claims supreme authority over its subjects.
- "All modern states claim authority over their citizens and that is one thing that distinguishes them from bands of robbers" p1

Legitimacy is not a necessary condition for the existence of the state.

Just rule is a necessary but not sufficient condition for authority.
- "A state is legitimate only if, all things considered, its rule is morally justified" p5

The exercise of authority is the mean to which states achieve their objectives. Its value is conditional upon the justice of those ends. p5

Our inability to bind ourselves to unjust actions is insufficient to explain the nature of contracts in general. p8

Defines a _social relations_ perspective which values not just the form of social order but the way it is achieved. p10

Political authority is necessary for societies because of distribution problems that the market or custom cannot achieve. The state is thus required to _authoritatively allocate_ values. p11

__Two concepts of authority__ p14

1.	A has authority over B iff B regularly complies with A's requirements.
2.	A has authority over B iff A's requirement that B ø forms a premise for B's ø-ing without B considering the merits of acting as A requires

Green supports the latter view noting that an order: p19

	"is accepted as binding only if it forms a premise for the subject's action without his considering the merits of what it requires." 

## The Nature of Authority	

A complete theory of the state needs to include an account of what it is for the state to exist as a differentiated form of social order, and explain the social characteristics that distinguish it. p21

The question of justifying authority can only arise if there is an authority to justify. p22

Appeals to authority are alternatives to appeals to reason.  They seeks to generate additional reasons to act. p26

Authority can be distinguished from advice (practical vs theoretical authority) via the intention of its proclamations and reactions to non-compliance. p26

"Expert advice gives seasons for belief, not action" p27

We are in no way bound to follow the advice of experts, only those in authority. p27

Authority relations are always triadic: A has authority over B in relation to matters C. p28

"Authoritative injunctions are purported to be categorical, to bind. But that does not entail that authority must be absolute" p29

"Authority bunds us to act even when we disagree with its requirements." p32

Authorities issue content independent reasons to act.  We can act contrary to the _balance of reasons_ without acting _contrary to reason._ p37

Authority is exclusionary. It's commands exclude other balance of reason calculations. p38

"Commands claim to be reasons for acting, not merely indications that there are other, and better, reasons for acting" p41

__Green's Def of Authority__ p41--42

	A has authority over B iff the fact that A requires B to ø gives B a content independent reason to ø, and excludes some of B's reasons for not ø-ing.

The institutional nature of authority is non-essential.  Institutions use, rather than explain, authority. p44

Generality is not an essential element of authority because one could have authority over another for a single discrete action (eg pushing a button) p51

_But a problem remains: If authoritative orders give content independent reasons for actions, but the scope of authority can be limited requiring content dependence, then aren't these orders just proxies for other reasons?_

__Legitimacy__

"The correct identification of a person as having authority over others depends only on certain facts about the practical reasoning of those who make or accept such claims" p59

Authority can therefore exist without being justified. p60

"Someone _claims_ authority when he makes requirements of another which he intends to be taken as binding, content-independent reasons for action; his authority is _recognised_ when another so treats the requirements; and ... _exists_ when its claims are generally recognised." p60  

All 3 are required for _de jure_ authority, while only 1 & 3 are necessary for _de facto_

## The Social Contract

Contractarianism is an attempt to show that authority would be agreed to by rational agents in the initial position of a state of nature. p122

They would do so because free cooperation is beneficial but not sustainable or stable.  All parties are aware of which actions are mutually beneficial and harmful but are not adequately motivated to perform them. p123

"It is an interesting fact about contractarian reasoning that the general economic conception of rationality of which it is a part has had its greatest success in explaining why authority is _unnecessary_ in order to attain desirable social states." p127

The competitive free market tends towards equilibrium and this equilibrium is the optimal point. (If all economic effects are internalised to the exchange relation.) p128

Pure public goods are non-rival, ie their consumption by some doesn't restrict their consumption by others, and non-excludable, ie it is very difficult to alienate them.

Essentially public goods are those that cannot be privatised such as friendship or benevolence. p129

Market failures to provide valuable public goods are often used to justify their securing via authority. Market failures are not sufficient to justify authority. p137.  To claim so requires prior authority to impose authority for the provision of the public good.

Anarchic provision of public goods further weakens claims to the necessity of authority p138.

Binding agreements presuppose the possibility of securing certain commitments and this creates a foundational dilemma for contractarians. p145 

"It is in some circumstances rational for all to agree to a mutual coercion scheme which forces them to cooperate by rendering defection too expensive and thus altering their preferences" p150

The state does more than coerce, it obligates. p151

Threats, like bargains, add to the balance of reasons. Authoritive orders are preemptive and exclusionary to other reasons.
