# The plan

1. Outline an account of when a belief that political authority is legitimate is warranted.

  - a belief that political authority is legitimate q, is warranted by evidence e, iff
    - e gives good reasons for believing p
    - reasons p logically entail q

2. Show how democratic theory has attempted to do this

  - Democracy is instrumentally sufficient

    1. Democracy results in good things
    2. Good things are sufficient to warrant authority
    3. Therefore democratic authority is warranted

  - Democracy is intrinsically sufficient
  
    1. Democracy is good
    2. Good is sufficient to warrant authority
    3. Therefore democratic authority is warranted

  - Authority is necessary & democracy is the least worst form

    1. Authority is necessary
    2. Democracy is least worst form of authority
    3. Therefore democratic authority is warranted

3. Show that these attempts have failed (and perhaps any attempt will fail)

  - The problem of the people
    
    1. Instrumental accounts require congruent accounts of inclusion
    2. Congruent accounts of inclusion are not provided
    3. Therefore democracy can't claim to produce good things

  - Paradoxes of procedure

    1. Democracy can't coherently aggregate preferences
    2. Democracy can't coherently aggregate judgements
    3. Therefore democracy can't claim to produce good things

    1. Intrinsic values only be realised through procedures
    2. Different procedures realise different values
    3. There are incompatible but equally justifiable values
    4. Agreement on procedures can never be reached
    5. Therefore democracy can't claim to produce the right good.

  - The limits of limits

    1. Democracy requires limits for it to function
    2. Those limits cannot be decided democratically
    3. Non-democratic limits aren't coherent with democracy's values
    4. Therefore democracy can't claim to produce the right good.
