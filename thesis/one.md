Chapter One
===========

States seek to rule.
Legitimacy gives subjects reasons to obey
Special relationship between democracy and legitimate authority
That authority is based on consent or instrumentalist reasons
Consent is not realisable in current forms of democracy
Instrumentalist accounts have to show that democracy creates good outcomes
What if democracy didn't influence outcomes?
What if who was included predetermined the outcome?
If this was the case, then we'd need some method of choosing the who that preserved democracies claim to superior outcomes.

The Boundary Problem
--------------------

The boundary problem is as simple as it is fatal to democracies claim to instrumental justifications.

It can be outlined as:

1.	Democracy makes claims of legitimacy. Democratic theory claims that political authority is legitimate just because (and often only because) that political authority is legitimate. A necessary condition of political legitimacy is that outcomes of the political process are actually determined by the mechanism that grounds the legitimacy. The process cannot be simultaneously arbitrary and legitimate.

1. 	But he 'who' in any democracy determines the 'what'.  The determination of who 'the people' are typically predetermines the outcome of any decision.  This is most obvious in cases of succession but also arises whenever the issue of suffrage is open - eg. gerrymander, redistribution or any normative analysis of inclusion.

3.	There is no current account that legitimates the people forming process.  Democratic theory can't answer the normative question of who ought be allowed to vote.  The question of who is logically prior to the question of how and attempting to solve the boundary problem from within democratic theory results in an infinite regress of who gets to vote on who gets to vote on who gets to vote onâ€¦ Other proposed solutions to the boundary problem - nation, culture, geography, salience, all-affected, & consent - have failed to support democracy's claims of legitimacy.  Democratic theory cannot therefore, claim that its political authority is legitimate.
