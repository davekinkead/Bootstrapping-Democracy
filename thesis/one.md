Chapter One
===========

- States seek to rule.
- Legitimacy gives subjects reasons to obey
- Special relationship between democracy and legitimate authority
- That authority is based on consent or instrumentalist reasons
- Consent is not realisable in current forms of democracy
- Instrumentalist accounts have to show that democracy creates good outcomes
- What if democracy didn't influence outcomes?
- What if who was included predetermined the outcome?
- If this was the case, then we'd need some method of choosing the who that preserved democracies claim to superior outcomes.

The Boundary Problem
--------------------

- The boundary problem is as simple as it is fatal to democracies claim to instrumental justifications.
- It can be outlined as:

	1.	Democracy makes claims of legitimacy. 
	
	2. 	But the 'who' in any democracy determines the 'what'. 
	
	3.	There is no current account that legitimates the people forming process.  
	
	4.	Democracy therefore, cannot claim any legitimate claims for the obedience of its subjects.

History

- Shouldn't a problem this significant have been extensively addressed in the literature?
- Dahl ([1970][dahl1970]) described it as a 'curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem'
- Whelan ([1983][whelan1983]) provides the first serious (and only) analysis of the problem and examines the sparsity of potential solutions
- Dahl ([1989][dahl1989]) returns again to the issue he calls 'the problem of constituting the unit' and  'the problem of inclusion'
- Arrhenius ([2005][arrhenius2005]) makes an unsuccessful attempt to solve the problem by invoking the all-affected principle
- Goodin ([2007][goodin2007]) commits himself to an acknowledged unworkable enfranchisement of all affected interests.
- Erman ([2011][erman2011]) offers a discourse-theoretical approach to the problem with the equal-influence principle
- Song ([2012][song2012]) Asks why the demos should be bounded by the state

Democracy and Authority
-----------------------

- accounts of political authority
- right to rule
- justified coercion
- imposition of duties

- what is so special about democracy?


Who Determines What
-------------------



An Unsolved Problem
-------------------

- democracy can't solve the problem internally
	- the question of who is logically prior to what
	- an infinite regress of voting on who votes
- all-affected principle has a strong prima facie case
	- who is affected is determined by the outcome
	- but the outcome is affected by who gets to vote
	- who is potentially affected is determined by who poses the question
	- who can pose the question has its own boundary problem
	- degree of affect also complicates the issue
	- to what extent must I be affected to have a say?
	- we'd need different jurisdictions for each issue
	- the only solution is to enfranchise all interests
	- but enfranchising someone who isn't affected reduces my autonomy just as much as disenfranchising me when I am affected.
	- the affect principle requires enfranchisement of all-and-only-affected interests
	- this reintroduces the problem of degree of affect and removes the global solution
- nationality and cultural salience provide another possibility
	- nationality follows boarders as much as boarders follow nations
	- there is no objective criteria for cultural salience
	- linguist and historical salience seem bad criteria for determining non-linguist/cultural issues
- geographic and economic features seem to delimit societies.
