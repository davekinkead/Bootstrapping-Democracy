# Bootstrapping Democracy

My thesis explores some of the paradoxes that lie at the very foundations of democratic theory.  Problems which collectively form what I call the Bootstrap Paradox - the inability of democratic theory to justify itself without resorting to some non-democratic means.

In the first half of my thesis, I examine how these foundational problems are generated by the competing conceptions of democracy and  various accounts of democratic legitimacy.  In the second half I propose a new account of democratic legitimacy based upon a normative principle I call Reciprocal Autonomy and a jurisdictional mechanism I call Dynamic Federalism.

##  1. The Bootstrap Paradox

Introduce the bootstrap paradox.

## 2. What Democracy?

- A brief survey of democratic literature.
- Distinguish various types of accounts.
- Outline the challenges for types of accounts.

## 3. Paradoxes of Procedure

1. According to procedural accounts of democracy, legitimacy is derived from adherence to some process.
2. The establishment of a process is logically prior to its existence.
2. But if procedure is the sole criterion of legitimacy, then its establishment cannot be legitimate.
4. Even if non-proceduralism is a criteria, it still must have some process to realise it.
5. Procedural accounts cannot be established legitimately.

## 4. Limits of Liberalism

1. Liberal theory posits the demarkation of individual from collective sovereignty.
2. But exactly where the demarkation should be drawn is hotly contested.
3. If these boundaries are determined by collectively, then what is private has become public.
4. If these boundaries are determined individually, then there seems no way to secure agreement.
5. It seems that neither liberal or democratic theory can satisfactory justify the demarkation required by liberalism.

## 5. The Boundary Problem

1. A primary aim of democratic theory is the justifying the authority of a properly constituted state. 
2. Democracy begins with the people but who the people are is largely ignored in democratic theory.
3. Yet the issue of who the people are largely determines the outcome of any democratic process.
4. No extant account solves the boundary problem, which therefore undermines all democratic legitimacy. 

## 6. Reciprocal  Autonomy

Develop a normative principle of non-authoritative political cooperation. 

- A universally agreeable foundational premise is the belief in our capacity for autonomy. To deny this is to assert it.
- Autonomy also seems intrinsic to the human condition and a value worthy aspect of democratic and liberal theory.
- I assert that recognising another's claim to self determination on the condition they recognise ours is a minimal normative condition for cooperation.
- Note I do not need to show this to be true, but merely convince you of its value.
- This principle is self justifying without being self enforcing.  To impose it on another (in contrast with liberalism) is to undermine the principle.
- The result is to undermine the moral foundations of authority - that there is no reason for another to do something, merely because it is commanded.
- This principle provides necessary foundations for political cooperation but is insufficient for it.

## 7. Dynamic Federalism

Develop a mechanism of political cooperation that adhere's to the principle of reciprocal autonomy.

- RA recognises everyone's right to self determination if they recognise ours.
- Cooperation is often highly beneficial but requires some mechanism to enable it.
- Authority can be regards as one such mechanism.
- By allowing people to choose their level of political association, simple majoritarianism is sufficient to meet the values of liberal democracy without succumbing to the bootstrap paradox.
- Each person is free to choose which jurisdiction they wish to be a part of pertaining to which particular issue.
- The relative benefits vs costs of cooperation will determine the extent of a jurisdiction (think Rousseau's general will)
- Liberal values will be preserved within pure majoritarianism as each member is free to ceed to a lower, more autonomous jurisdiction.

## 8. Objections

- can issues be demarcated? 
- property rights
- punishment
- free riding
