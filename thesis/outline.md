The Boundary Problem of Democratic Theory
=========================================

My thesis explores normative issues of suffrage and jurisdiction, and in particular, seeks to solve the boundary problem in democratic theory, which is to say:

	How can you democratically answer the question of who can vote on a particular issue without first presupposing who can vote on the issue of who can vote?

The boundary problem arises whenever we examine who ought be allowed to vote.  Historically, the issue has been ignored and just who 'the people' are simple taken for granted.



CH1 - The Boundary Problem
--------------------------

A brief history of the problem:

- Dahl 1970 'curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem'
- Whelan 1983 'The boundary problem' **This is the canonical work**
- Dahl 1989 'The problem of constituting the unit, the problem of inclusion'
- Arrhenius 2005 'The boundary problem'
- Goodin 2007 'The problem of constituting the demos'
- Erman 2011 'The boundary problem' ???? Just found on SSRN
- Song 2012 'Why the demos should be bounded by the state' - just found

The constituent elements of the boundary problem that are necessary for it to arise are:

1. 	The who in any democracy determines the how and what.  The determination of who 'the people' are typically predetermines the outcome of any decision.  This is most obvious in cases of succession but also arises whenever the issue of suffrage is open - eg. gerrymander, redistribution or any normative analysis of inclusion.

2.	Democratic theory makes claims of legitimacy.  Specifically, democratic theory claims that political authority is legitimate just because (and often only because) that political authority is legitimate. A necessary condition of political legitimacy is that outcomes of the political process are actually determined by the mechanism that grounds the legitimacy. The process cannot be simultaneously arbitrary and legitimate.

3.	There is no current account that legitimates the people forming process.  Democratic theory can't answer the normative question of who ought be allowed to vote.  The question of who is logically prior to the question of how and attempting to solve the boundary problem from within democratic theory results in an infinite regress of who gets to vote on who gets to vote on who gets to vote onâ€¦ Other proposed solutions to the boundary problem - nation, culture, geography, salience, all-affected, & consent - have failed to support democracy's claims of legitimacy.  Democratic theory cannot therefore, claim that its political authority is legitimate.

The nature of the problem results in few imperatives for the solution:

- that the solution can actually solve the problem ie. bound the people in a legitimate way,
- that the solution doesn't negate the need for democratic theory.  If the solution bounds the people in a legitimate manner, it may likely also provide a framework for political legitimacy making normative democratic theory redundant.


CH2 - Who Determines What
-------------------

This chapter will outline the extent of the problem.  It will attempt to answer:

- The question of who is logically prior to the questions of how or what
- How often does the boundary problem arise?
- Does it apply to all normative questions of suffrage & jurisdiction?
- Is there some mathematical description to it?



CH3 - Authority, Democracy & Legitimacy
----------------------

This chapter will serve to examine the relationship between democracy, legitimacy and authority.

Clarify meaning & intent of legitimacy.  Raz (1988) provides a good starting point for analysis - legitimacy imposes a moral duty to accept the directives of an authority.  One may obey any authority for any reason but legitimate authority preempts these reasons and requires obedience just because it is legitimate.

Current accounts regarding the source of political legitimacy are:

- consent
- consequential
- deontological

**Deontological**, primarily Kantian accounts like Rawls' posit that legitimacy stems from rationality.  Thus a political authority is legitimate just in case it is an authority that all rational agents would agree to.  Currently I have no good argument why we shouldn't accept this kind of Kantian account in principal without presupposing the primacy of agency & therefore consent.

**Consequential** accounts of legitimacy hold that authority is legitimate because it create beneficial consequences.  Numerous problems with this type of account in general (who's benefit, how can an authority know what's really in my interest) and democratic theory in general (can only support democracy contingently when democratic processes are instrumental to beneficial consequences, while it provides greater support to benevolent tyranny).

**Consent** theories seem to hold the most plausibility (political authority is legitimate just because I choose to follow it) but face seemingly insurmountable challenges with respect to the state.  This is because the state is not a free association and makes exclusive territorial claims of sovereignty.



CH4 - The All-Affected Principle
----------------------------

This chapter will examine the all affected principle as a normative principle.  It will show why it is a poor principle of normative democratic theory and why something like Burnheim's only-affected principle is much better.

The goal is to establish the only-affected principle, something akin to a legitimate material interest as, as a foundational norm of inclusion but demonstrate why it still can't solve the boundary problem.

	The reason it can't solve the boundary problem is because of potentiality.  Affect is determined by the outcome of a decision but the outcome isn't know ahead of time.  As such, we need to use potential affect as the criteria.  Yet potential affect of an outcome is determined by what the issue actually is, which in turn raises the meta-question of who can propose issues.  This has its own boundary problem.

	An example:
	Should community A compensate community B for some past injustice - say pollution from their new power plant? If the vote is no, then no one is affected (relative to the status quo) but if yes, then the peoples of A and B are.  Potentiality requires us to consider all and only those potentially affected by the outcome - both A and B.  

	But who can even propose this vote? Can community C who aren't materially affected by the pollution propose a vote for A & B on the matter? If yes, then can I propose a vote that the uber-rich (of which sadly I am not currently a member), be taxed extra to help the poor in say Africa (of which luckily I am not a member)?

CH5 - Consent Theories
-------------

What are the problems with consent theories?

There are currently three broad approaches to consent theory:

- explicit consent
- implicit consent
- hypothetical consent

Explicit consent cannot exist while the state makes exclusive claims of sovereignty.  No current conception of democracy supports this. End of story!

Implicit consent from Locke onwards is hugely problematic and objections are well documented, whether consent is implied by residency, voting or some other action. Essentially, consent is an act of voluntary choice and there is no way of distinguishing (say in the case of voting) voting as consent to be governed vs voting to select the least worst outcome.  Unless I am free from coercion or can add my own preference option to the ballot, consent can't be implied.

Hypothetical consent, as outlined by Estlund, would hold that non-consent can be negated if, when given the opportunity to consent, we refuse to consent when we ought have.  The massive problem with this is that effectively creates a duty to consent, thereby delegating the normative force to another level & failing to explain why we ought have consented.  It simply converts consent theories of authority into deontological or consequential accounts.

What can we do to rescue the problem?

I'm going to define consent as an act of agreement in the absence of coercion.  


CH6 - Dynamic Federalism
------------------------

- consent is the most viable source of legitimacy for political authority
- in order to consent, I must:
  - be free to do otherwise
  - not be coerced into my choice
- as per the consent chapter, an authority imposing any costs of non-consent must have some preexisting moral right to impose those costs.
- a legitimate state cannot therefore impose costs upon me if I do not consent to its authority:it must give up exclusive sovereign claims over me.

The problem then is essentially this:

	How can the state maintain claims of exclusive territorial sovereignty while providing the consent dynamics of free association?

My very rough solution is dynamic federalism.  People can form free associations of legal jurisdictions under the umbrella of a national/global state.  The extent of any particular jurisdiction is the extent that people agree to be bound by a particular law.
