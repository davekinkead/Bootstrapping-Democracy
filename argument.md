This document outlines the general argument of my PhD dissertation 'Bootstrapping Democracy'.  It is an experiment in structured writing that I hope can rescue me from this wretched mid-candidature writers block.  As such, it is organised in a logical rather than rhetorical manner.  

Starting with my central thesis, I will state my key claims followed by the justificatory premises that entail them.  The argument should be read hierarchically:

    - thesis
      - support 1
        - support 1.a
        - support 1.b
          - support 1.b.i
          - support 1.b.ii
        - support 1.c
      - support 2
      - support 3

The idea is that this will enable a logical yet non-linear approach to writing - allowing me to run with ideas that look promising, and temporarily sidestep any holes in my account that are holding me back, returning to them later when my thoughts are clearer.

That's the hope, anyway.

# Democracy is the just rationalisation of political authority

### Democracy and Justification

- Democracy is the rationalisation of political authority 
  - If a proper justification of democratic authority existed, then it would be broadly recognised.
    - democracy is the preeminent form of modern political authority
    - there is a long history of democratic justification
    - from within existing democracies
    - it is desired by those denied it
  - A proper justification of democratic authority isn't broadly recognised.
    - its odd that there is such a broad approach to justifying democracy but little consensus on how
    - list them!!!
    - they all focus on different parts but rarely on the whole
    - these justifications are in conflict - compatibility is impossible
  - Therefore a proper justification of democratic authority doesn't exist. 
    - if these accounts don't succeed in justifying democracy, what do they do?
    - the state exists and claim authority
    - authority is the power of one agent to morally command another
    - legitimacy is the moral justification of enforcing authoritative commands     
    - authority is claimed to be necessary. we are compelled to obey legitimate ones.
    - so how doe we justify the imposition on those who don't benefit?
    - democracy is the justification of this imposition.  It makes disagreement with authority palatable.

### The Problem of the People

- The boundary problem is really three problems
  - Democracy cant define the demos
    - A demos is necessary for democratic processes
    - A demos defining itself is circular
    - One demos defining another is an infinite regress
  - Incorrectly defining the demos contradicts democratic values
  - The causal role of who the people are undermines democratic legitimacy
  
  
- Difference making accounts can't justify democratic authority
  - Democratic legitimacy rely on difference making
    - Democracy produces different outcomes than other forms of government (and non-government)
    - Democratic outcomes are superior to other outcomes
    - These outcomes are sufficient to justify democratic authority
  - Difference making is undermined by the problem of inclusion
    - For democratic outcomes to justify authority, the cannot be arbitrary
    - Who the people are predetermines the result of any democratic process
    - The problem of inclusion makes the outcomes of democratic processes arbitrary
  - Difference making accounts cant solve the problem of inclusion
    - Democracy requires a demos
    - Who the people are is temporally and logically prior democratic processes

  
### Paradoxes of Procedure
    
- Purely procedural accounts can't justify democratic authority
  - Democratic legitimacy rely on procedures
  - Legitimate procedures can only be produced via higher order legitimate procedures
    - The only way to justify democracy is procedurally
    - Higher order procedures can create other procedures
    - A legitimate procedure cannot be produced _sui generis_ 
  - Foundational procedures cannot be produced legitimately  
    - If a procedure cannot be legitimated democratically, then it must be legitimated non-democratically
    - If a procedure is legitimated non-democratically, then it is not a purely procedural justification of democracy
  
  
### The Limits of Liberalism

- Liberal accounts cannot justify democratic authority
  - Liberal accounts justify authority because it realises certain goods (freedom)
  - These freedoms require limits on others
  - Liberal democracies must impose some form of the good as a procedural constraint
  - An independent conception of the good can either be agreed to by all, or forced upon dissenters
  - Liberal democracies will necessarily generate competing conceptions of the good, so there will be dissenters
  - In liberal democracies, the imposition of the good conflicts with its substantive value.
  

### Authority, Necessity and the State

** This is still pretty nascent**
  
- Political authority is unnecessary for the state
  - social cooperation is necessary to realise substantive ends
  - enforcement is necessary to solve problems of social coordination
  - the state is the dominate mechanism of enforcement and social cooperation
  - if the actions commanded by an authority benefit all, then authority is not necessary to motivate the action.
  - if authority is necessary for an action, then the action does not benefit all.
  - enforcement can occur without authority
  - warranting enforcement can give the state's actions legitimacy without independent political authority
  - political authority is unnecessary for the state

- Free association is compatible with the state.
  - demonstrate how warranting consequences is sufficient for complex social cooperation
  - demonstrate how this can occur in a voluntary state
