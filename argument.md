This document outlines the general argument of my PhD dissertation 'Bootstrapping Democracy'.  It is an experiment in structured writing that I hope can rescue me from this wretched mid-candidature writers block.  As such, it is organised in a logical rather than rhetorical manner.  

Starting with my central thesis, I will state my key claims followed by the justificatory premises that entail them.  The argument should be read hierarchically:

    - thesis
      - support 1
        - support 1.a
        - support 1.b
          - support 1.b.i
          - support 1.b.ii
        - support 1.c
      - support 2
      - support 3

The idea is that this will enable a logical yet non-linear approach to writing - allowing me to run with ideas that look promising, and temporarily sidestep any holes in my account that are holding me back, returning to them later when my thoughts are clearer.

That's the hope, anyway.

Thesis: To be legitimate, democracy must be voluntary

- prolog 
  - authority is the power of one agent to morally command another
  - legitimacy is the moral justification of enforcing authoritative commands
  - the state exists and is claimed to be necessary. we are compelled.
  - so how doe we justify the imposition on those who don't benefit?
  - democracy is the justification of this imposition.

- Inclusion undermines difference making
  - Democracy requires the existence of a people
  - But democracy can't determine who should be included in the people
  - Therefore who should be included amongst the people can only be determined non-democratically
    - why should this be troubling?
  - Non democratic accounts can conflict with accounts of democratic legitimacy
    - Legitimacy sometimes requires difference making - which accounts?
    - Who the people are determines what they decide
    - If democracy wants legitimacy, it must show causal influence in its outcomes
    - Who the people fully determines democratic outcomes
    - Democratic legitimacy can't be based on difference making
  
- Pure proceduralism is incoherent
  - Democracy requires procedures
  - If legitimacy is purely procedural, then procedure cannot be legitimated democratically
    - bulk of original work will be on this premise. examine procedural paradoxes
  - If procedure cannot be legitimated democratically, then it must be legitimated non-democratically
  - If procedure is legitimated non-democratically, then it is not purely procedural
  - Therefore pure proceduralism cannot legitimate democratic authority

- There is no independent good in politics
  - Substantive justifications of democracy require an independent conception of the good
  - Liberal democracies must impose some form of the good as a procedural constraint
  - An independent conception of the good can either be agreed to by all, or forced upon dissenters
  - Liberal democracies will generate competing accounts of the good, so there will be dissenters
  - In liberal democracies, the imposition of the good conflicts with its substantive value.
  - ** Ideas for here...
  - ** Liberalism requires that dissenter be labelled 'unreasonable'
  - ** But no one thinks they are unreasonale
  - ** How does a liberal get agreement on who is unreasonable
  - ** Public Justification Liberalism will endorse contradiction
  
  
- Political authority is unnecessary for the state
  - social cooperation is necessary to realise substantive ends
  - enforcement is necessary to solve problems of social coordination
  - the state is the dominate mechanism of enforcement and social cooperation
  - if the actions commanded by an authority benefit all, then authority is not necessary to motivate the action.
  - if authority is necessary for an action, then the action does not benefit all.
  - enforcement can occur without authority
  - warranting enforcement can give the state's actions legitimacy without independent political authority
  - political authority is unnecessary for the state

- Free association is compatible with the state.
  - demonstrate how warranting consequences is sufficient for complex social cooperation
  - demonstrate how this can occur in a voluntary state
