Locke - Second Treatise of Civil Government

CH2 Of the State of Nature

The state of nature consists of perfect freedom and political equality.  This is a marked contrast with Hobbes.

"we must consider, what state all men are naturally in, and that is, a state of perfect freedom to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man" §4

Man has liberty but not license.  Natural law is based on reason and teaches that no one ought harm another. **Why?**

We all belong to God, No subordination that allows one to destroy another (self preservation exempted)

Law without enforcement is no law at all.  If anyone has a right to enforce natural law, then equality demands that everyone



CH 8 - On the Beginnings of Political Society
---------------------------------------------

The foundation of political society is consent.  Natural law grants men self ownership, so only they can divest themselves of their liberty, and doing so harms no one.  

- "Men being, as has been said, by nature, all free, equal, and independent, no one can be put out of this estate, and subjected to the political power of another, without his own consent. The only way whereby any one divests himself of his natural liberty, and puts on the bonds of civil society, is by agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community for their comfortable, safe, and peaceable living one amongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a greater security against any, that are not of it." §95

- "And thus that, which begins and actually constitutes any political society, is nothing but the consent of any number of freemen capable of a majority to unite and incorporate into such a society." §99

Political authority stems from consent of the governed:

- "by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation, to every one of that society, to submit to the determination of the majority, and to be concluded by it" §97

Consent to be governed is given by simply being or enjoying the benefits of government:

- "every man, that hath any possessions, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, cloth thereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such enjoyment, as any one under it" §119

- "Nothing can make any man so, but his actually entering into it by positive engagement, and express promise and compact" §122

Government authority covers only lands and those upon them.  

- "whenever the owner, who has given nothing but such a tacit consent to the government, will, by donation, sale, or otherwise, quit the said possession, he is at liberty to go and incorporate himself into any other common-wealth" §121

Justifies majority rule becomes the determination of political will with a 'greatest force' requirement.  Universal agreement is not practical in groups with diverse opinions or desires: 

- "for that which acts any community, being only the consent of the individuals of it, and it being necessary to that which is one body to move one way; it is necessary the body should move that way whither the greater force carries it, which is the consent of the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue one body, one community, which the consent of every individual that united into it, agreed that it should; and so every one is bound by that consent to be concluded by the majority" §96

- "the variety of opinions, and contrariety of interests, which unavoidably happen in all collections of men, the coming into society upon such terms would … make the mighty Leviathan of a shorter duration, than the feeblest creatures, and not let it outlast the day it was born in" §98

Locke anticipates two objections, but fails to anticipate an objection to consent in being: 

- "First, That there are no instances to be found in story, of a company of men independent, and equal one amongst another, that met together, and in this way began and set up a government.  Secondly, It is impossible of right, that men should do so, because all men being born under government, they are to submit to that, and are not at liberty to begin a new one. " §100


**Questions**

- Locke describes the evolution of political societies from family to monarchy to majoritarian rule §105-110.  When should patriarchal power give way to consent of the governed?

- How does political authority work in Locke's view?  

- Man consents to government (§95) and his possessions and lands become subject to it (§120).  He is free to move elsewhere (§121) but his property remains "perpetually and indispensably" subject (§121).  Doesn't this conflict with the idea of individual property rights?

- Consent is an act of free will and free will requires an ability to do otherwise.  How can consent be given is an agent doesn't have means to move to land 'in vacuis locis'?
