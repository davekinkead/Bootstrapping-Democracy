CH1 Government in General
-------------------------

Rousseau sets up his argument for the separation of powers and form of government.  Like all action is a result of will and power, the body politic is is composed of the legislature and the executive.

- "What then is government? An intermediate body set up between the subjects and the Sovereign, to secure their mutual correspondence, charged with the execution of the laws and the maintenance of liberty, both civil and political."

Equality and balance are key themes as he outlines a geometric argument.  As a people grow, their powers over the sovereign and liberties diminish; a more powerful executive is needed to control them; and a more powerful legislature is needed to limit the executive.

- "The government gets from the Sovereign the orders it gives the people, and, for the State to be properly balanced, there must, when everything is reckoned in, be equality between the product or power of the government taken in itself, and the product or power of the citizens, who are on the one hand sovereign and on the other subject."

- "Furthermore, none of these three terms can be altered without the equality being instantly destroyed. If the Sovereign desires to govern, or the magistrate to give laws, or if the subjects refuse to obey, disorder takes the place of regularity, force and will no longer act together, and the State is dissolved and falls into despotism or anarchy"

- "the larger the state, the less the liberty"

- "The government, then, to be good, should be proportionately stronger as the people is more numerous."


CH2. The Constituent Principle in the various Forms of Government
-------------

Rousseau continues his geometric argument.  The power of the executive is fixed to the size of the state; the more populated the executive, the weaker it is.  People tend to act in self-interest; the more populated the executive, the weaker it is.  So the most active form of government is a monarchy.

- "But the total force of the government, being always that of the State, is invariable; so that, the more of this force it expends on its own members, the less it has left to employ on the whole people.  The more numerous the magistrates, therefore, the weaker the government. This principle being fundamental, we must do our best to make it clear."

- "According to the natural order, on the other hand, these different wills become more active in proportion as they are concentrated. Thus, the general will is always the weakest, the corporate will second, and the individual will strongest of all: so that, in the government, each member is first of all himself, then a magistrate, and then a citizen — in an order exactly the reverse of what the social system requires."

- "We can see, for instance, that each magistrate is more active in the body to which he belongs than each citizen in that to which he belongs, and that consequently the particular will has much more influence on the acts of the government than on those of the Sovereign; for each magistrate is almost always charged with some governmental function, while each citizen, taken singly, exercises no function of Sovereignty."


CH3. The Division of Governments
-------------------------------

Rousseau defines various forms of government.  In this context, democracy means direct democracy, aristocracy also includes representational democracy and monarchies include any dictatorships.

- "the Sovereign may commit the charge of the government to the whole people or to the majority of the people, so that more citizens are magistrates than are mere private individuals. This form of government is called democracy."

- "Or it may restrict the government to a small number, so that there are more private citizens than magistrates; and this is named aristocracy."

- "it may concentrate the whole government in the hands of a single magistrate from whom all others hold their power. This third form is the most usual, and is called monarchy"

- "If, in the different States, the number of supreme magistrates should be in inverse ratio to the number of citizens, it follows that, generally, democratic government suits small States, aristocratic government those of middle size, and monarchy great ones."


CH4. Democracy
--------------

Rousseau rallies against direct democracy as it would mix particular concerns with general ones. 

- "It is not good for him who makes the laws to execute them, or for the body of the people to turn its attention away from a general standpoint and devote it to particular objects. Nothing is more dangerous than the influence of private interests in public affairs, and the abuse of the laws by the government is a less evil than the corruption of the legislator, which is the inevitable sequel to a particular standpoint."

- "It is against the natural order for the many to govern and the few to be governed. It is unimaginable that the people should remain continually assembled to devote their time to public affairs, and it is clear that they cannot set up commissions for that purpose without the form of administration being changed."

- "there is no government so subject to civil wars and intestine agitations as democratic or popular government, because there is none which has so strong and continual a tendency to change to another form, or which demands more vigilance and courage for its maintenance as it is."


CH5. Aristocracy
----------------

Any group ruled by a few can be called an aristocracy.  Rousseau clearly views representative democracy as the best form of government

- "There are then three sorts of aristocracy — natural, elective and hereditary. The first is only for simple peoples; the third is the worst of all governments; the second is the best, and is aristocracy properly so called."

- "Besides the advantage that lies in the distinction between the two powers, it presents that of its members being chosen; for, in popular government, all the citizens are born magistrates; but here magistracy is confined to a few, who become such only by election.22 By this means uprightness, understanding, experience and all other claims to pre-eminence and public esteem become so many further guarantees of wise government.

- Moreover, assemblies are more easily held, affairs better discussed and carried out with more order and diligence, and the credit of the State is better sustained abroad by venerable senators than by a multitude that is unknown or despised.

- In a word, it is the best and most natural arrangement that the wisest should govern the many, when it is assured that they will govern for its profit, and not for their own. There is no need to multiply instruments, or get twenty thousand men to do what a hundred picked men can do even better. But it must not be forgotten that corporate interest here begins to direct the public power less under the regulation of the general will, and that a further inevitable propensity takes away from the laws part of the executive power."


CH6. Monarchy
-------------

Monarchies are inferior because they encourage subjugation of the people and prevent the best for rising up and fulfilling higher positions.

- "The best kings desire to be in a position to be wicked, if they please, without forfeiting their mastery: political sermonisers may tell them to their hearts' content that, the people's strength being their own, their first interest is that the people should be prosperous, numerous and formidable; they are well aware that this is untrue. Their first personal interest is that the people should be weak, wretched, and unable to resist them. I admit that, provided the subjects remained always in submission, the prince's interest would indeed be that it should be powerful, in order that its power, being his own, might make him formidable to his neighbours; but, this interest being merely secondary and subordinate, and strength being incompatible with submission, princes naturally give the preference always to the principle that is more to their immediate advantage."

- "while in monarchies those who rise to the top are most often merely petty blunderers, petty swindlers, and petty intriguers, whose petty talents cause them to get into the highest positions at Court, but, as soon as they have got there, serve only to make their ineptitude clear to the public."


CH9. The Marks of a Good Government
-----------------------------------

Rousseau argues that "What is absolutely the best form of government?" can't be answered but that "Are the people governed well?" can be.  Yet there is little agreement about what constitutes 'well governed'.  His metric is simply population growth.

- "What is the end of political association? The preservation and prosperity of its members. And what is the surest mark of their preservation and prosperity?"
