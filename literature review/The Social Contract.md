The Social Contract - JJ Rousseau
=================================

Book I
------

"I shall endeavour always to unite what right sanctions with what is prescribed by interest, in order that justice and utility may in no case be divided." CH0

**CH1 Subject of the First Book** 

Social order is the foundation for all other rights but it doesn't come from nature. It is founded upon conventions.

- "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains."

- "As long as a people is compelled to obey, and obeys, it does well; as soon as it can shake off the yoke, and shakes it off, it does still better; for, regaining its liberty by the same right as took it away, either it is justified in resuming it, or there was no justification for those who took it away."

**CH2 The First Societies**

The most basic society is the family.  Liberty of the children is subjugated only while it is necessary.  Once his own master, the family remains a unit by convention alone.
Man is born free and this society is a result of the nature of man.

- "This common liberty results from the nature of man. His first law is to provide for his own preservation, his first cares are those which he owes to himself; and, as soon as he reaches years of discretion, he is the sole judge of the proper means of preserving himself, and consequently becomes his own master."

- "and all, being born free and equal, alienate their liberty only for their own advantage."

**CH3 The Right of the Strongest**

Denies the right of the strongest.  If the right to rule comes from strength, then that right can be over ruled when someone strong comes along.  Duty to obey is a necessity, not moral choice or obligation and is void when those rules have strength enough to fight for their liberty.

- "THE strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms strength into right, and obedience into duty."

- "To yield to force is an act of necessity, not of will — at the most, an act of prudence. In what sense can it be a duty?"

- "As soon as it is possible to disobey with impunity, disobedience is legitimate; and, the strongest being always in the right, the only thing that matters is to act so as to become the strongest."

**CH4 Slavery**

Convention is the source of all legitimate authority.  Denies slavery by the inability of man to give up moral duty (giving up everything makes indemnity impossible), as well as countering the right of the victor in war.

- "SINCE no man has a natural authority over his fellow, and force creates no right, we must conclude that conventions form the basis of all legitimate authority among men."

- "Before they come to years of discretion, the father can, in their name, lay down conditions for their preservation and well-being, but he cannot give them irrevocably and without conditions: such a gift is contrary to the ends of nature, and exceeds the rights of paternity"

- "To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties …… to remove all liberty from his will is to remove all morality from his acts."

Rousseau's utopian state of nature is evident (and strongly contrasts with Hobbes's state of war of all against all)

- "Men, from the mere fact that, while they are living in their primitive independence, they have no mutual relations stable enough to constitute either the state of peace or the state of war, cannot be naturally enemies."

- "War then is a relation, not between man and man, but between State and State, and individuals are enemies only accidentally, not as men, nor even as citizens,3 but as soldiers; not as members of their country, but as its defenders. Finally, each State can have for enemies only other States, and not men; for between things disparate in nature there can be no real relation."

- "The words slave and right contradict each other, and are mutually exclusive."

**CH5 That we must always go back to a First Convention**

The beginnings of defining 'the people'.  Extrapolates his argument against slavery to that of non-popular sovereignty.

- "Indeed, if there were no prior convention, where, unless the election were unanimous, would be the obligation on the minority to submit to the choice of the majority? How have a hundred men who wish for a master the right to vote on behalf of ten who do not? The law of majority voting is itself something established by convention, and presupposes unanimity, on one occasion at least."

**CH6 The Social Compact**

Rousseau offers an account of voluntary association to improve the lot of all

- "But, as men cannot engender new forces, but only unite and direct existing ones, they have no other means of preserving themselves than the formation, by aggregation, of a sum of forces great enough to overcome the resistance."

- ""The problem is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides the solution."

The key aspect of the social contract is that each man totally alienates their own sovereignty to ensure political equality.  Man can only be free if each gives them self fully to the association equally.  No departure from full subjection and equality can be made lest some then hold more power over others than they hold over themselves.

- "These clauses, properly understood, may be reduced to one — the total alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole community; for, in the first place, as each gives himself absolutely, the conditions are the same for all; and, this being so, no one has any interest in making them burdensome to others."

- "for, if the individuals retained certain rights, as there would be no common superior to decide between them and the public, each, being on one point his own judge, would ask to be so on all; the state of nature would thus continue, and the association would necessarily become inoperative or tyrannical."

- "each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of what he has."

- "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will, and , in our corporate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole."

Thus, the general will is formed

- "this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will. "

**CH7 The Sovereign**

The people through the contract become the sovereign.  The sovereign cannot bind itself to anything that infringes upon itself or its original act. The sovereign cannot have any interest contrary to that of its members.

Strangely: the subject needs no protection from the sovereign (it is always what it should be) but the subject is compelled to obey by the whole body.

- "public deliberation, while competent to bind all the subjects to the Sovereign, because of the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded, cannot, for the opposite reason, bind the Sovereign to itself"

- "This means nothing less than he will be forced to be free"

- "Duty and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to give each other help: and the same two men should seek to combine, in their double capacity, all the advantages dependent upon that capacity"

**CH8 The Civil State**

By entering into the social contract, man looses his natural liberty and unlimited right to everything but gains civil liberty and proprietorship of all he possesses.

Distinguishes natural liberty (bounded only by his strength) vs civil liberty (limited by the general will); and possession (ownership by force or first) vs property (founded on positive title)

CH9 - Property rights only exist under a collective association.  By the sovereign rights to all common property (and will all men subjects of the sovereign) then personal ownership is strengthened against brute force and annexation.

3 conditions for the right of first occupier:
- the land must not be inhabited,
- man must only occupy the amount needed for subsistence
- ownership can only be asserted through labour, not mere claim.

Questions
=========

How does Rousseau's attack on slavery support his claim that only voluntary associations are legitimate? Is it a conclusive disjunction?

What is the relationship between the Sovereign, general will, State, Government, prince and magistrate?

Does the formation of the Sovereign require consensus? How does Rousseau balance his conflicting remarks?
