Dahl, R (1956) Populistic Democracy in A Preface to Democratic Theory, University of Chicago Press, Chicago.

Primary critique of majoritarianism can be pigeon holed as ethical, empirical or technical
- technical objections relate primarily to social choice theory & Arrow's Theorm
- ethical objections: why are political equality & popular sovereignty ends; are they absolute ends and at what cost?
- to what extend does majoritarianism lead to democratic ends; checks are needed on majorities destroying the system of majoritarianism.

On jurisdiction, Dahl notes that the bounds of inclusion & exclusion are amount the most rigid of political phenomena (p53)
Geography provides a practical constraint
Selection of boundaries becomes highly problematic for Dahl

Dahl also raises temporal issues.  Popular opinion changes; how soon should law reflect those changes and why?
