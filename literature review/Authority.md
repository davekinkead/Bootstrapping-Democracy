Authority

Notes from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authority/

Differing conceptions and usage of authority

- Political authority vs political power
- Normative authority (legitimate) vs descriptive authority (de facto)
- Theoretical authorities give reasons for beliefs. Practical authorities give reasons for actions
- Authority as legitimate coercion merely requires a moral justification for the imposition of an agent's political power over others. (weak moral bonds between subject & authority)
- Authority as capacity to impose duties. (moderate moral bond)
- Authority as a right to rule. There is also a distinction here between internal authority (who must be obeyed) and external authority (who may not be interfered with) (strong moral bonds for internal authorities)

Duty to Obey

Christiano makes a bold claim: "The duty of the subject is grounded not in the content of the command itself but in the nature of the source issuing the commandâ€¦the duty to obey is content independent or independent of the content of the particular command. One must obey because one has been commanded and not because of the particular content of the command. One must do it because one has been told to do it."

Raz's instrumental account of normal authority

- "An authority does its job well and is therefore legitimate when it enables subjects to act better on the reasons that apply to them when they take the commands as giving them preemptive reasons."

Simmons's Anarachism

- An agent has a right not to be subjected to another's duties
- An agent can only be bound if they have consented
- A state can't be setup so that it can demand the obedience of all and only those who consented
- ergo, states can't be legitimate

Questions

- is illegitimate authority an oxymoron? Is legitimacy a necessary, constituent factor of political authority. 
- if I recognise an authority as legitimate, do I have a duty to obey?
- does legitimacy of authority only extend to certain dimensions?
