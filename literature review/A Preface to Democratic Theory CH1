Dahl, R (1956) Madisonian Democracy in A Preface to Democratic Theory, University of Chicago Press, Chicago.

Madison's Hypotheses:

H1: If unrestrained by external checks, any given individual or group of individuals will tyrannise over others (p6)
(Tyranny here is claimed to be a severe deprivation of a natural right)

H2: The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same hands implies the elimination of external checks;  The elimination of external checks produces tyranny;  Therefore the accumulation of all powers in the same hands produces tyranny.

"Give all power to the many, they will surpress the few.  Give all power to the few, they will surpress the many." (Hamilton)
