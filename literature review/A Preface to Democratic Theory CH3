Dahl, R (1956) Polyarchal Democracy in A Preface to Democratic Theory, University of Chicago Press, Chicago.

Polyarchy is loosely defined as any political system where the following exists to a high degree: (p84)
- every individual performs acts that express interest towards alternatives
- equal weighting is assigned to those preferences
- the alternative with the greatest amount of preferences wins
- any individual can insert a preferred set of alternatives
- all individuals possess identical information about the options
- the winner preferences are executed
- inter-election decisions are subordinate to election decisions

Polyarchy is governed primarily via social means
"in the absence of certain social prerequisites, no constitutional arrangements can produce a non-tyrannical republic" (p83)

The condition of political equality requires interchangeability.  the interchange of equal amounts from one group to another would not affect the outcome of a decision. (p65) - samples of groups must be homogenous.
