The Social Contract - JJ Rousseau

Book II

The Sovereign is Inalienable CH1
- conflicting interest necessitates society
- mutual interest enables society
- society is tied by the common interest
- the Sovereign cannot be removed from the general will

The Sovereign is Indivisible CH2
- the general will is the will of all
- if the general will was divided, it is no longer general

Rousseau fails to deal with what defines 'a people'.  Why can't there by 2 general wills within a city

Whether the General Will is Fallible CH3
- the general will is merely the common interest
- but the will of all is not the sum of individual wills
- the general will can be found when all people have adequate interest and do not form blocks or divisions
- the forming of blocks creates a general will of the block but the blocks will is a particular will in relation to the state
- a majority of voters cannot express the general will because it ignores the will of the minority

The Limits of the Sovereign Power CH4
- just as man controls his bodily parts, the Sovereign controls the people with absolute power.
- each person must obey the Sovereign but the Sovereign can only demand what is best for the general will
"The undertakings which bind us to the social body are obligatory only because they are mutual"
- when applied to particulars, the general will becomes particular (and therefore no longer the general will)

The Limits of Sovereign Power CH4
- just as man controls his bodily parts, so the Sovereign controls its citizens with absolute power.
- Man must obey the Sovereign but the Sovereign can only demand what is best for the general will.  "The undertakings which bind us to the social bond are obligatory only because they are mutual"
- when applied to particulars, then general will becomes the particular will
- the general will is less about the number of citizens and more about the common interest that binds them as each submits to the system he imposes on others.
-"This admirable agreement between interest and justice gives to the common deliberations an equitable character which at once vanishes when any particular is discussed, in the absence of a common interest to unite and identify the riling of the judge with that of the party."
- acts of sovereignty are the convention between a body and each of its members.
- if the sovereign is legitimate, then submitting to it is merely submitting to one's own will.

Death CH5
- a citizen must obey the Sovereign even if ordered to die
- Rousseau characterises the death penalty as a contract (but fails to see that know one agrees to it)
"The state has no right to put to death, even for the sake of making an example, anyone whom it can leave alive without danger"

The Law CH6

"Justice, to be admitted among us, must be mutual"
- when directed against a particular, the law cannot represent the general will
- the law must be considered enmas and in abstract to represent the general will.
- the law is merely a civil association and the people subject to it ought be its authors

Legislators CH7
- to eliminate despotism, command over people must be seperated from command over law.
- politics and religion are not common objects but each used to aid the other
- men have called upon divinity to engender docility of the people

The People CH8/9/10
"Liberty may be gained but never recovered"
- an optimal size of state exists and is determined by the nature of the people and land
- distance between the citizen and legislator decreases knowledge, loyalty and social bonds (early power distance)
- large states make universal laws difficult, esp with populations.

Systems of Legislation CH11
- the goal of a political system should be liberty and equality
- equality is characterised as power and wealth distributed such that no man can force or buy another
- the nature of society is towards inequality so we must tend towards maintaining equality.


The Division of the Laws CH12

Lists 4 types of laws (and conventions):
- political (the state upon itself)
- civil (between citizens)
- criminal (between citizens and the law)
- moral and social conventions
