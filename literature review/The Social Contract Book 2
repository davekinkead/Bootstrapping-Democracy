The Social Contract - JJ Rousseau
=================================

Book II
-------

The Sovereign is Inalienable CH1
--------------------------------

- conflicting interest necessitates society
- mutual interest enables society
- society is tied by the common interest
- the Sovereign is nothing less than the general will
- the Sovereign cannot be removed from the general will

"THE first and most important deduction from the principles we have so far laid down is that the general will alone can direct the State according to the object for which it was instituted, i.e., the common good: for if the clashing of particular interests made the establishment of societies necessary, the agreement of these very interests made it possible."

"The common element in these different interests is what forms the social tie; and, were there no point of agreement between them all, no society could exist. It is solely on the basis of this common interest that every society should be governed."

"I hold then that Sovereignty, being nothing less than the exercise of the general will, can never be alienated, and that the Sovereign, who is no less than a collective being, cannot be represented except by himself: the power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will."


The Sovereign is Indivisible CH2
--------------------------------

- the general will is the will of all
- if the general will was divided, it is no longer general

Rousseau fails to deal with what defines 'a people'.  Why can't there by 2 general wills within a city

"SOVEREIGNTY, for the same reason as makes it inalienable, is indivisible; for will either is, or is not, general;6 it is the will either of the body of the people, or only of a part of it."


Whether the General Will is Fallible CH3
----------------------------------------

- the general will is always correct but the people's deliberations may not be
- the general will is the common interest of the people
- but the will of all is just the sum of individual wills
- the general will can be found when all people have adequate interest and do not form blocks or divisions
- the forming of blocks creates a general will of the block but the blocks will is a particular will in relation to the state
- a majority of voters cannot express the general will because it ignores the will of the minority
 - Does he place too great a requirement on the people?

"IT follows from what has gone before that the general will is always right and tends to the public advantage; but it does not follow that the deliberations of the people are always equally correct."

"If, when the people, being furnished with adequate information, held its deliberations, the citizens had no communication one with another, the grand total of the small differences would always give the general will, and the decision would always be good."

"It is therefore essential, if the general will is to be able to express itself, that there should be no partial society within the State, and that each citizen should think only his own thoughts"

The Limits of the Sovereign Power CH4
-------------------------------------

- If the purpose of the state is the preservation of the people, it must have power over all.
- By requiring everyone to submit to the common will, no individual can have power over another.
- Man must obey the Sovereign but the Sovereign can only demand what is best for the general will.  
- when applied to particulars, then general will becomes the particular will
- the general will is less about the number of citizens and more about the common interest that binds them as each submits to the system he imposes on others.
- acts of sovereignty are the convention between a body and each of its members.
- if the sovereign is legitimate, then submitting to it is merely submitting to one's own will.
- there is a strong equality & symmetry in his argument.

IF the State is a moral person whose life is in the union of its members, and if the most important of its cares is the care for its own preservation, it must have a universal and compelling force, in order to move and dispose each part as may be most advantageous to the whole.

"The undertakings which bind us to the social bond are obligatory only because they are mutual"

"This proves that equality of rights and the idea of justice which such equality creates originate in the preference each man gives to himself, and accordingly in the very nature of man."

"It should be seen from the foregoing that what makes the will general is less the number of voters than the common interest uniting them; for, under this system, each necessarily submits to the conditions he imposes on others: and this admirable agreement between interest and justice gives to the common deliberations an equitable character which at once vanishes when any particular question is discussed, in the absence of a common interest to unite and identify the ruling of the judge with that of the party."

Implicitly requirement of initial consent

- "When these distinctions have once been admitted, it is seen to be so untrue that there is, in the social contract, any real renunciation on the part of the individuals, that the position in which they find themselves as a result of the contract is really preferable to that in which they were before."


Death CH5
---------

- a citizen must obey the Sovereign even if ordered to die
- Rousseau characterises the death penalty as a contract (but fails to see that know one agrees to it)
"The state has no right to put to death, even for the sake of making an example, anyone whom it can leave alive without danger"


The Law CH6
-----------

"Justice, to be admitted among us, must be mutual"
- when directed against a particular, the law cannot represent the general will
- the law must be considered enmas and in abstract to represent the general will.
- the law is merely a civil association and the people subject to it ought be its authors

Legislators CH7
- to eliminate despotism, command over people must be seperated from command over law.
- politics and religion are not common objects but each used to aid the other
- men have called upon divinity to engender docility of the people

The People CH8/9/10
"Liberty may be gained but never recovered"
- an optimal size of state exists and is determined by the nature of the people and land
- distance between the citizen and legislator decreases knowledge, loyalty and social bonds (early power distance)
- large states make universal laws difficult, esp with populations.

Systems of Legislation CH11
- the goal of a political system should be liberty and equality
- equality is characterised as power and wealth distributed such that no man can force or buy another
- the nature of society is towards inequality so we must tend towards maintaining equality.


The Division of the Laws CH12

Lists 4 types of laws (and conventions):
- political (the state upon itself)
- civil (between citizens)
- criminal (between citizens and the law)
- moral and social conventions
