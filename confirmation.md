# Bootstrapping Democracy

PhD Confirmation Paper, target 5000 words

I'm fascinated by normative issues of suffrage and jurisdiction.  Why is it that marriage is a matter of federal law but de facto relations are determined by state law; and what normative principle could possibly justify this distinction?  Why do we typically think universal suffrage is some kind of democratic virtue when over inclusion dilutes our autonomy and political voice just as much as under inclusion does?  Democratic theory stands on questionable normative foundations, that like any building, threaten to topple a range of higher order concerns relating to political legitimacy, authority, and obligation.  

While I am clear on the broad topic of my research, at this stage I really don't feel confident to present some definitive outline of a thesis I am happy to defend over 80,000 words.  There are simply too many interrelated questions try and answer first.  So rather than provide a rough outline of what I plan to submit in a few years time, I thought it would be more productive, stimulative of thought, and of course more fun, to offer a polemic argument related to my research. To wit...

## Democracy is not Democratic

How does a people decide exactly who should be included amongst the people? The democratic method would be to vote on the matter but then who should vote? It can’t be _the people_ because who _the people_ are is only determined after the vote has been tallied.  How does a people decide the boundaries of the political and the demarcation of personal from collective decisions? Again, voting can’t be the solution because limiting the domain of the political via collective decision is itself a political action, while voting to increase the political makes vacuous the whole notion of the personal.  How does a people agree to an electoral system when the choice of electoral system itself requires agreement on an earlier electoral system in order for the choice to be democratic? 

These democratic dilemmas form part of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox - the inability of democratic systems to justify themselves democratically. In each case, a democratic solution seems impossible without either unanimous agreement or resort to non-democratic means, and neither of these solutions is attractive to a democrat.  Unanimous, collective agreement is both practically unlikely and indistinguishable from unanimous non-collective non-binding agreement. Non-democratic justifications, if substantive enough, threaten to undermine accounts of democratic legitimacy and tempt us to reject democracy in favour of these prior non-democratic ideals.

I'm going to defend the paradoxical thesis that democracy is not democratic. Its establishment, alteration and operation all require justificatory recourse to non-democratic ideals, and any substantively non-democratic system cannot be justified as being democratic.  Or perhaps it can be if we reject contemporary accounts of democracy in favour of an instrumentalist account of collective autonomy.  I'm not sure yet and I still have considerable work to do before I'm confident supporting these claims either way.

The aim of this paper 

### The Bootstrap Paradox

1. A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.
2. A substantive number of systems & procedures cannot be called democratic by any coherent interpretations of the term.
3. Democracy cannot be justifiably labelled democratic.


## What Democracy?

Like many paradoxes it is possible, likely even, that the Bootstrap Paradox is little more than invalid deduction camouflaged by semantic equivocation.

- Our first question is does democracy --> democratic or democratic --> democracy?
- Democracy is something that is democratic

- Democracy is a vacuous term
- Etymology suggests we start at Athens - rule by the people
- What could popular sovereignty mean? by, for, or of?
- Yet democracy predates athens - participation, equality
- Voting seems synonymous but is neither necessary nor sufficient. Sortition, Soviet, monitory, psephocracy
- Democratic totalitarianism, freedom, liberalism, justice
- Autonomy
- Conflicting relations between these concepts


## Some Problems

Outline:

- the boundary problem
- the constitution paradox
- the limits of liberalism
- voting on voting


### Boundaries

	"Political Philosophers can only begin once the Generals are finished."

The first bootstrapping problem I wish to examine is what has come to be know as the Boundary Problem.

History

## Objections

### Do We Need Foundations?

- Anti-foundationalists (Rortey) will argue that justifications based on external factors are deceptive
- But anti-foundationalists can't make any substantive normative claims.

### Non Democratic foundations are ok
