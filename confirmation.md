# Bootstrapping Democracy

PhD Confirmation Paper, February 2013

### Introduction 

Democratic theory stands upon shaky normative grounds, that like any building, threaten to topple a range of higher order concerns relating to political legitimacy, authority, and obligation.  Despite a revival of interest in the normative foundations of democracy from political theorists over the last 40 years, little progress has been made beyond Churchill's pragmatic quip that 'democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time'.  Perhaps because democracy _can't_ be justified.

The very nascent, and still amorphous thesis that I intended (perhaps) to defend in my dissertation is that democracy, according to extant accounts at least, cannot be coherently defended.  

Contemporary accounts of democracy can be roughly divided into those justified on external grounds and those justified from internal ones.  External, or foundationalist justifications, all rely on some pre-democratic notion or principle upon which their account is built such as freedom, equality or autonomy.  Internal, or anti-foundationalist justifications, on the other hand, claim that any attempt to justify democracy on something outside its practice is disingenuous because those alleged foundations can only be interpreted through the prism of existing practices [^Rorty2006idealizations]. We must only, anti-foundationalists claim, compare actual non-ideal practices against other potentially realisable non-ideal practices.

Both types of accounts face obstacles.  The challenge for foundationalist accounts in general is two fold. Firstly, they must find some common ground upon which all parties can agree to.  For Hobbes, this was necessity; for Locke, liberty; and for Rawls, justice.  Secondly, they must show how their account is entailed from these agreed upon foundations.  If what we fear most is _bellum omnium contra omnes_, then subjugation to the Leviathan is the price we must all pay. If however, it is freedom we value above all else, then we must protect ourselves from the encroachment of the state; while if justice is the only thing reasonable and rational men unaware of their future positions would agree to, then we are committed to the wide redistribution of primary goods.

These two challenges are significant, and given the level of debate in political theory about these issues, largely unsettled.  But foundationalist accounts of democracy face additional challenges.  If democracy is the realisation or instrument of some pre-democratic notion, then why do we need to justify democracy in the first place? If democracy is simply the result of prior foundations, then why not focus our justificatory efforts on those instead?  Or if democracy has instrumental value in obtaining those foundational values, then justifications of democracy must also show that it is the only, or at least best, instrument to obtain them.

Anti-foundationalist accounts face their own set of challenges.  Some critiques of anti-foundationalism have charged it with irrationalism and emotivism [^talisse2004democracy:69], offering little more justification of democratic practices than what ever is, is; that if democratic theory is unable to rest on external foundations and must instead rely only upon pragmatic discourse as the method of reason, then the only justifiable democratic practice is whichever one exists once all the talking has stopped.  Clearly, this interpretation is uncharitable - anti-foundationalists don't claim that all justifications are disingenuous, only ones based on self evident, a priori, or axiomatic external truths.  Anti-foundationalism in this vain parallels Darwinistic accounts of evolution.  It is just as ludicrous to ask why freedom ought be valued over equality as it is to ask why primitive mammals were more morally deserving of survival than giant reptiles [^Rorty2006idealizations:334].  Foundationalists, they claim, are simply asking the wrong question.

But still the problems linger.  If the normative principles of democracy can only be justified from within the actual practice itself, what form could these justifications take?  Rorty[^Rorty2006idealizations:335] for example, suggests substituting external foundations with the idea that what makes us special is "our ability feel for, cherish, and trust people very different from ourselves", but this appears to be nothing more than a foundationalist claim about human nature.  Even if we limit our justifications to _more of this practice and less of that_, we must still justify _these_ claims somehow if we ever want to make normative comparisons - _why_ more of this practice is better than less of that one.  If we can't justify one form of democracy over another, then we can't justify some democracy over some non-democracy. Anti-foundationalism fails to allow this comparison.

My hope, or perhaps naive optimism, is that in the course of the next few years research I can identify a different justificatory account of democracy that avoids failing foul of these dilemmas.  My intuition is that democracy can be built upon foundations, but foundations that are internal to democracy itself. Much like recursive formula or mathematical induction, democratic theory will then be able to pick itself up by its own bootstraps. Call this non-foundationalism, or perhaps, _bootstrapping_. 

## Democracy is not Democratic

How does a people decide exactly who should be included amongst the people? The democratic method would be to vote on the matter but then who should vote? It can’t be _the people_ because who _the people_ are is only determined after the vote has been tallied.  How does a people decide the boundaries of the political and the demarcation of personal from collective decisions? Again, voting can’t be the solution because limiting the domain of the political via collective decision is itself a political action, while voting to increase the political makes vacuous the whole notion of the personal.  How does a people agree to an electoral system when the choice of electoral system itself requires agreement on an earlier electoral system in order for the choice to be democratic? 

These democratic dilemmas form part of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox - the inability of democratic systems to justify themselves democratically. In each case, a democratic solution seems impossible without either unanimous agreement or resort to non-democratic means, and neither of these solutions is attractive to a democrat.  Unanimous, collective agreement is both practically unlikely and indistinguishable from unanimous non-collective non-binding agreement, making the state no different from anarchy. Non-democratic justifications on the other hand, if substantive enough, threaten to undermine accounts of democratic legitimacy and tempt us to reject democracy in favour of these prior non-democratic ideals.

For the rest of this paper, I'm going to defend the paradoxical thesis that roughly maps my larger thesis outline, namely that democracy is not democratic. Its establishment, alteration and operation all require justificatory recourse to non-democratic ideals, and any substantively non-democratic system cannot be justified as being democratic.  Or perhaps it can be if we reject contemporary accounts of democracy in favour of something else entirely.  I'm not sure yet and I still have considerable work to do before I'm confident supporting these claims either way.

### The Bootstrap Paradox

My core argument can be stated as follows:

1. A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.
2. A substantive number of these systems & procedures cannot be called democratic by any coherent interpretations of the term.
3. Democracy therefore, cannot be justifiably labelled democratic.

Of course, this paradox only bites if the premises are true.  Like many paradoxes it is possible, likely even, that the Bootstrap Paradox is little more than invalid deduction camouflaged by semantic equivocation.  So considerable effort will need to be spent clarifying exactly what _democracy_ means according to contemporary accounts of it.  Not only has democracy come to represent a range of _ideals_ such as freedom, equality and popular sovereignty, it has also been variously interpreted as a _system_ which legitimates authority, distributes power, aggregates preferences, and creates knowledge.  These interpretations of democracy determine and constrain the normative justifications of contemporary accounts of democracy.  This is the focus of Part One of my thesis.  

In Part Two, I will be examining a number of problems that lie at the foundations of democratic theory.  How can a people define itself in a way that doesn't undermine the legitimacy of the state?  Are coherent democratic process for succession or unification even possible? How can a constitution be created and ratified democratically? How can the contested limits of liberalism be determined democratically without undermining liberalism itself?  These dilemma show that no extant account of democracy is able to provide sufficient normative justifications for the meta-processes, such as demarkation, creation, and alteration, required for the operation of the state.  And if sufficiently many processes and procedures of a system of government are not democratic, then that system cannot justifiably be called democratic.

Part Three will, or at least I hope it will, provide some possible solutions the problems I have just raised.  Currently, my thoughts on this are too underdeveloped to present anything of note, other than my aim to use an inductive or recursive processes to bootstrap my account of democracy.  What follows is a brief summary of Parts One and Two.

## What Democracy?

### Ideals

_Democracy_ in modern parlance has become a vacuous term, a simple substitute for vague, positive feelings towards one form of government or another.  It has become synonymous with notions of equality and popular sovereignty, justice and rule of law, voting and majoritarianism, liberalism and freedom; yet many of these values conflict and some necessarily so.  But when a term means everything, it means nothing.  

Conceptions of democracy guide and constrain accounts of democratic legitimacy, and it is clear that contemporary views of it vary widely.  The recent debate on compulsory voting in Australia is illustrative.  Liberal Senator Nick Minchin has claimed that "compulsory voting is an infringement of the democratic rights of Australians" [^2] while Victorian Liberal MP Josh Frydenberg praises it as "a pillar of democracy"[^3].  When the one proposal can be simultaneously labelled both democratic and undemocratic, by members of the same party even, then it is obvious the term is too vague to be a useful tool of analysis. Some clarification is in order and I will attempt to make explicit exactly what notion of democracy I will be invoking.

Etymology suggests we start in Athens. Herodotus was supposedly the first to coin the term _demokratia_ (δημοκρατία) to denote rule of the people or more precisely, popular sovereignty [^isakan2011:22].  Popular sovereignty though, can be variously thought to mean rule _of_ the people, _for_ the people, and _by_ the people.  Rule _of_ the people suggests the demos as the source of sovereignty.  Typically, the consent from, contract with, or benefit of the people is the medium through which political authority to the state and obligation of the demos is legitimated.  Clearly this prevents hereditary monarchies and autocratic regimes from claiming the label _democracy_ but still encompases a number of non-democracies like popular totalitarians [^populartotalitarian][^sondrol1991totalitarian].

Rule _by_ the people implies a active role for the citizen in the decision making process.  Participation in the formulation of rules and norms which guide the coercive power to which a citizen is subjected to, are a key part of .... 
 a form of direct and participatory democracy, while rule _for_ the people suggests that their will and interest is to a large degree manifested into law.

These characteristics however, seem largely absent from contemporary democratic states, and even to Athens itself.  Democracy today has become synonymous with representational democracy and few states integrate significant levels of referenda and plebiscite into the political process [^landsgemeinde].  There is little active role for the citizen outside of elections and popular participatory mechanisms such as forums rarely if ever wield formal power.  Special interest groups and lobbyists exercise overwhelming influence on the political agenda through what Lawrence Lessig calls dependence corruption [^lessig2011], a process whereby public debate is restricted to only those issues successfully contested amongst large donors.

Yet even in Athens, rule was only ever _of_, _for_ and _by_ a minority of the people. Citizenship extended to less than a quarter of inhabitants whilst suffrage was restricted to adult male citizens who represented only a tenth of the total population including metics and slaves [^hansen1991athenian].  For the vast majority of people in Athens, the coercive force of the state was something they had no influence over and which had little regard for their wellbeing.  If popular sovereignty is a constituent factor of democracy, then it has only ever been realised as an ideal, and a largely distant one at that.

How the people rule seems just as much an issue of democracy as who rules.  Voting is often thought to be the most democratic method of making collective decisions but it is neither a necessary, nor sufficient element of democracy.  In stark contrast with modern states, voting played a much smaller role in ancient democracies.  In Athens for example, most public appointments such as magistrates, jurors and archons were based sortition or lot, with voting limited to the Assembly and the appointment of generals [^hansen1991athenian].

Conversely, many non-democratic states employ voting in the political process, sometimes on a large scale.  In the former Soviet Union, elections were frequent, held every two years, the franchise was universal to all adult residents, election was by simple majority, and voting was conductive in private booths to ensure secrecy of the ballot [^jacobs1970soviet].  Of course, in the post Stalin years, candidates were limited to members of the Communist party and pre-approved by higher Soviets, rending elections to simple binary ratifications of the status quo by ticking the box or crossing out the name of the sole candidate on the ballot paper.  

Modern democratic states by contrast, are characterised by free and procedurally fair competitive elections with universal active franchise. Yet active franchise, the right to run for office, is often a right in name only.  In states whose electoral system is primarily based on plurality voting, the ability to run for office is severely constrained by economic means, leading to extensive dependency on party or donor support.  In Australia, only five of the 226 federal politicians are independents, and all these were previous party members [^aph] while in the US, George Washington remains the only independent President ever elected [^whitehouse], and the average wealth of a US Senator is estimated to be $14 million (median $2.5 million) [^USwealth].  This dependency on wealth or access severely limits the typical citizen's capacity to run for office and makes it far more comparable in actual, rather than prescribed terms, to elections in the Soviet Union.  

The contemporary conflation of voting and democracy becomes understandable once we consider access to power and equality.  The practical restriction of active franchise and absence of popular participation in contemporary psephocracies [^psesphocracies] makes voting instrumentally important in engendering some level equal political rights.  The notion of one vote, one value reflects another ideal - _isonomia_ or equality under the law that was central to ancient democracies [^manville1975origins].  Yet as John Burnheim [^burnheim2006democracy] shows, sortition is also compatible with equality, and noting the inequality of political access in modern states, it is likely that sortition provides a greater assurance of isonomia than competitive elections can.  As such, if voting does play any constitutive role in democracy, then it is purely instrumental, and a contingent one at that.

While seemingly necessary, it seems obvious that popular sovereignty, equality, and participation are insufficient to properly encompass contemporary notions of democracy.  Imaging for a moment, a world where the demos exercises full sovereignty over the state and all decisions made with equal and direct participation.  Every morning, the citizens debate and vote on what everyone will eat for breakfast, what they will wear and what they will do that day.  Today, we must all eat coco-pops and wear pink because that is what we've all decided, collectively and equally.  Yet few would accept this form of popular totalitarianism to be democratic because it lacks sufficient concern for individual liberty.

Liberalism has been the traditional response to the encroachment of collective or arbitrary power over the individual.  Liberalism has a rich history, encompasses a diverse range of ideas and has spawned a number of variant which I lack the space to cover in detail.  Classical accounts portray liberalism as a kind of optimal set of collective constraints necessary for the maximisation of individual freedom for all, or what Oliver Wendell Holmes described as "the right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins".  New, or social accounts of liberalism contrast this with a greater focus on the positive freedoms necessary to realise one's full potential, but all variants share a fundamental core value - the primacy of the individual and the presumption of freedom over its encroachment [^gauss1996justificatory].

It is the addition of liberalism to the ideals of popular sovereignty and equality that leads to internal conflict within the nature of democracy.....

Do I take liberalism to be a constitutive element of democracy?....  The contemporary notion does.... But are rights/issues the only dimension of liberalism....what about liberalism via jurisdiction.....

- Autonomy
- Conflicting relations between these concepts...The constraints of liberalism are explicit in their intention to limit popular sovereignty.

### Systems


	- show democracy can also mean a system
	- aggregating preferences - social choice theory
	- knowledge creation 
	- limit conflict

### Justifications

Justifications and accounts of democracy are shaped by these interpretations.  A full review of contemporary, let along historical, democratic accounts is well beyond the scope of this paper but a few clarificatory notes are in order.  Democratic accounts can be conceptualised along a variety of dimensions but two in particular will be useful for my analysis: the instrumental / intrinsic and the procedural / substantive dichotomies.  The instrumental / intrinsic dichotomy concerns whether democracies are justified by the good outcomes that democratic processes bring about, relative to others, or whether their justifications are derived from qualities inherent to their methods.  It is concerned with how legitimacy is _derived_.  The procedural / substantive dichotomy by contrast concerns whether democratic outcomes are justified by their adherence to certain processes and procedures, or whether they promote certain values and ideals.  It is concerned with how legitimacy is _assessed_.


- instrumental vs intrinsic (how legitimacy is derived)
	- instrumental
		- epistemic - condorcet
		- consequential - sen / Mill, 1861, Chapter 3
	- intrinsic
		- justification - cohen
		- self rule - gould	
- procedural vs substantive (how legitimacy is assessed)
	- procedural
		- epistemic proceduralism 
		- participatory premise justification - gauss 
	- substantive
		- participatory - rorty
		- equality - rawls

- least worse - churchill	


Non-procedural accounts on the other hand, justify democracy how well ....

### Directions

With these distinctions about the nature and justification of democracy in mind, we can now better address the first premise: 

>  P1 - A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.

One immediate concern here lexical priority.  Do democracies become democratic through their actions or are the actions of a democracy democratic a priori?  The later is certainly the easier solution as it make democracies democratic axiomatically.  But while simpler, this approach offers us little philosophical insight into the problem.  Our problem is identifying a method to evaluate the democratic nature of states - what we want is a way to justifiably say this state is democratic whist this one is not [^heuristic].

But if this is the case, we must also determine just how democratic does a system or state need to be in order to be called a democracy.

A related issue is that of potentiality and realisation....

## Problems and Paradoxes

	- introduce some major foundational paradoxes
	- the boundary problem
	- the constitution paradox
	- the limits of liberalism
	- voting on voting
	- Barnett’s paradox of authority3 and Michelman’s paradox of democratic procedures.4 

A range of paradoxes and problems lie at the foundations of democratic theory, problems that collectively form part of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox.  A few of these where hinted at earlier: How can constitution be created legitimately when adherence to the constitution is the criterion of legitimacy?  How can a people legitimately determine who should be included or exclude as part of the 'the people' when the logically prior matter of _who_ is asked determines the outcome?  How can the people collectively determine the boundary of personal freedoms and public rules without making the notion of personal liberty vacuous?



### The Paradox of Constitution

Founding provides the first set challenges.  According to typical accounts of constitutional democracy [cite or reference earlier], legitimacy is derived from adherence to the constitution....

It's a contractual/procedural account....

1.	An act has legitimacy iff it is fidelitous to constitutional processes
2.	The initial act of founding necessarily occurs prior to any constitutional processes
3.	Therefore the act of founding cannot be legitimate

### Limits of Liberalism

1.	Liberalism requires the protection of personal freedoms from public...
2.	sdfsd.

My coverage of these problems thus far only hints at the subsequent challenges they pose to democratic legitimacy.  I intend to cover these and other foundational problems is much greater detail in my broader thesis but examination of one will support my second premise:

> P2 - A substantive number of these systems & procedures cannot be called democratic by any coherent interpretations of the term.

### The Boundary Problem

The story of democracy begins with a people.  They come together, unite, proclaim, declare and form as one:

> "We the People  of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America" [^preambleUSconstitution]

> "Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania ... have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under ... the Constitution hereby established" [^preambleAUconstitution]

> "Le peuple français proclame à nouveau que tout être humain, sans distinction de race, de religion ni de croyance, possède des droits inaliénables et sacrés" [^preambleFRconstitution]

Democratic theory is built upon an assumption that a people, _the people_, exist and exist rightfully so.  Yet who the people _ought_ be, and therefore which group should rightfully govern themselves, is a totally neglected [^whelan1983preface] and absolutely crucial problem for which there seems no theoretical solution to [^dahl1970after].  

This problem of inclusion and boundaries is separate from, although closely related to, the issue of suffrage and franchise.  Issues of franchise typically deal with who amongst those subjected to the coercive force of the law ought have some say in its formulation.  Whilst most modern liberal states no longer discriminate on the grounds of race or gender, resident aliens, children, and ex-felons are still formally excluded from the democratic process, and citizens with limited economic means are often informally excluded in a number of 'liberal' jurisdictions.  The Boundary Problem [^boundaryproblem] by contrast, relates to the issue of who should be subjected to the coercive force of the state - who should be a member of this jurisdiction rather than that.

The problem in the Boundary Problem arises once we recognise that who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to any subsequent democratic theory, and that extant accounts of democracy have been unable to solve this dilemma.  Normative democratic theory aims to provide us with an account of democratic legitimacy [^christiano2008]. It seeks to make evaluative and comparative claims concerning when and why democracy is desirable.  A central requirement of this endeavour is difference making.  Preference of one form of government over another, or of one form of democracy over another, requires that differing systems of government bring about different results, answers or states of affairs. In procedural accounts of democracy like Estlund's for example, the morally binding force of the results from a deliberative mechanism are derived from the epistemic virtues of that mechanism.  A legitimate process of law making needs to produce different, and superior, results to that of an illegitimate one for the account to be coherent.  Likewise for substantive accounts such as Rawls'.  A system that produces inequalities is legitimate only if those benefit the worst off members of society.  Without difference making, there can be no criteria upon which to make comparative evaluations.

But the Boundary Problem undermines democracy's ability to make these claims of legitimacy because that matter of who ought be included amongst the people makes subsequent processes arbitrary.  Consider for a moment, questions of inclusion and exclusions.  Say a sufficient number of people within a nation state have a strong desire for greater autonomy and self government like West Papua, the Basque region of Spain, or the states of the former Yugoslavia.  If we assume that all parties are committed to identical democratic procedures and values, then the outcome of any decision regarding independence of the succeeding state will depend wholly on who is included in the processes.  If only the population of the succeeding state is involved, then the answer will be very different to if only the people of the successor state are, and different again if both peoples are.  

This is not an problem that democratic theory can solve itself.  If we take legitimacy to be derived from fidelity to some democratic procedure, then it is immediately clear that a democratically legitimate solution results in an infinite regress.  If we are to vote, justify or deliberate on the issue of who should be included amongst the people, then we must first vote, justify or deliberate on the prior issue of who decides who decides who is included.  But to do this, we must first decide who decides on that, and so on.  If on the other hand, we take legitimacy to be derived from some substantive notion or ideal, then we are still face with the problem.  As I will show shortly, extant substantive justifications fail to provide a a plausible solution.  Even if they did however, it is highly unlikely that any substantive value that underpins democracy would ever be universally accepted.  As such, some collective process or procedure is required to settle disputes over values and these processes are subject challenges that face procedural accounts.

The Boundary Problem extends far beyond issues of inclusion and exclusion however - it infects almost every collective action. Consider a proposal for redistribution for example.  Very different outcomes will occur if only the 'haves', the 'have nots', or both depending on the ratio of the two, are permitted a say in the matter, and this can occur even when both parties are committed to the same democratic processes and values.  Because the assumption of a fixed people is so ingrained in our dominant political paradigms, it is illustrative to consider a trans-national example.  It is clear that the First World's quality of life and living standards come partly at the expense of the Third World.  Agricultural subsidies in Europe and the US that depress prices and limit export revenue from Africa and Latin America [^farmsubsidies], and developed countries using energy and resources at rates far beyond what global per capita share permits [^iea] are but two examples of this.  It can be reasonably argued on ground of justice and equality then, that the developed world ought compensate or redistribute some of its wealth to the developing world.  Yet even if all parties agree on a decision process and value justice and equality, the outcome will be different depending on who is included.  This is because there may still be disagreement about how to best realise those values, how much to redistribute, the method of redistribution, or even conflict with various other values the groups may hold such as responsibility or sovereignty.

Thus, we must resort to non or pre democratic justifications to solve the Boundary Problem.  This is not, in and of itself, problematic.  We saw earlier that the notion of democracy is one built upon a collection of related and conflicting pre-democratic ideals, so there is no prima facie objection to a solution based on non-democratic means that still preserves the legitimacy of subsequent democratic processes.  The dilemma for political theorist however, is that extant non democratic solutions are incapable of this.

Frederick Whelan [^whelan1983preface] provides us with a comprehensive summary of possible solutions. Historical accident and the status quo is an unacceptable solution owning to its complete arbitrariness.  To make the legitimacy of contemporary democracy dependent on the contingencies of history seems ludicrous.  That Australia is a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic owes as much to that fact that in 1766 Louis-Antoine de Bougainville arrived at the Great Barrier Reef rather than Botany Bay, as it does to the 1999 referenda process.

Nationality as the basis of inclusion is also highly problematic.  The idea that state boundaries should roughly correspond with pre-existing nation units has been dominant since the Treaty of Westphalia.  But only a cursory examination is necessary to dismiss nationality as suitable.  There appears to be no single objective criterion that is definite, and the non-voluntary nature of nationality stands in stark contrast to principles of democracy. Only the most homogenous contemporary states only comprise a single culture or language group [^homogenous] and cultural, linguistic or historical salience seem implausible grounds for determining non-linguistic or cultural issues.  

Furthermore, boundaries appear to determine nationality as much as nationality determine boundaries; one only need to speak of the Soviet, Yugoslavian, or even Italian or Australian people to recognise this.  Likewise, geographic or economic salience offer limit hope for a solution.  Rivers divide as often as provide a focal point for human settlement; mountains only seem like boarders to people from the plains; and satellite imagery of boarder towns and cities show just how strongly economic ties are determined by existing jurisdictions. 

Two other principles more aligned with democratic values have also been proposed as solutions.  

- all-affected principle has a strong prima facie case
	- who is affected is determined by the outcome
	- but the outcome is affected by who gets to vote
	- who is potentially affected is determined by who poses the question
	- who can pose the question has its own boundary problem
	- degree of affect also complicates the issue
	- to what extent must I be affected to have a say?
	- we'd need different jurisdictions for each issue
	- the only solution is to enfranchise all interests
	- but enfranchising someone who isn't affected reduces my autonomy just as much as disenfranchising me when I am affected.
	- the affect principle requires enfranchisement of all-and-only-affected interests
	- this reintroduces the problem of degree of affect and removes the global solution






## Future Directions

- parts one, two & three of thesis
- conceptualise democracy purely as self rule, justification focus only on political authority
- solve boundary problem & others with a procedural legitimacy that is also substantive - self rule
