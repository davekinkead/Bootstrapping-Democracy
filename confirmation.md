# Bootstrapping Democracy

PhD Confirmation Paper, February 2013

### Introduction 

Democratic theory stands upon shaky normative grounds, that like any building, threatens to topple a range of higher order concerns relating to political legitimacy, authority, and obligation.  Despite a revival of interest in the normative foundations of democracy from political theorists over the last 40 years, little progress has been made beyond Churchill's pragmatic quip that 'democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time'.  Perhaps because democracy _can't_ be justified.

The very nascent, and still amorphous thesis that I intended (perhaps) to defend in my dissertation is that democracy, according to extant accounts at least, cannot be coherently defended.  Contemporary accounts of democracy can be roughly divided into those justified on external grounds and those justified from internal ones.  External, or foundationalist justifications, all rely on some pre-democratic notion or principle upon which their account is built such as freedom, equality or autonomy.  Internal, or anti-foundationalist justifications, on the other hand, claim that any attempt to justify democracy on something outside its practice is disingenuous because those alleged foundations can only be interpreted through the prism of existing practices [^Rorty2006idealizations]. We must only, they claim, compare actual non-ideal practices against other potentially realisable non-ideal practices.

The challenge for foundationalist accounts in general is two fold. Firstly, they must find some common ground upon which all parties can agree to.  For Hobbes, this was necessity; for Locke, liberty; and for Rawls, justice.  Secondly, they must show how their account is entailed from these agreed upon foundations.  If what we fear most is _bellum omnium contra omnes_, then subjugation to the Leviathan is the price we must all pay. If however, it is freedom we value above all else, then we must protect ourselves from the encroachment of the state; while if justice is the only thing reasonable and rational men unaware of their future positions would agree to, then we are committed to the wide redistribution of primary goods.

These two challenges are significant, and given the level of debate in political theory about these issues, largely unsettled.  But foundationalist accounts of democracy face additional challenges.  If democracy is the realisation or instrument of some pre-democratic notion, then why do we need to justify democracy in the first place? If democracy is simply the result of prior foundations, then why not focus our justificatory efforts on those instead?  Or if democracy has instrumental value in obtaining those foundational values, then justifications of democracy must also show that it is the only, or at least best, instrument to obtain them.

Anti-foundationalist accounts face their own set of challenges.  Some critiques of anti-foundationalism have charged it with irrationalism and emotivism [^cite?], offering little more justification of democratic practices than what ever is, is; that if democratic theory is unable to rest on external foundations and must instead rely only upon pragmatic discourse as the method of reason, then the only justifiable democratic practice is whichever one exists once all the talking has stopped.  Clearly, this interpretation is uncharitable - anti-foundationalists don't claim that all justifications are disingenuous, only ones based on self evident, a priori or axiomatic external truths.  Anti-foundationalism in this vain parallels Darwinistic accounts of evolution.  It is just as ludicrous to ask why freedom ought be valued over equality as it is to ask why primitive mammals were more morally deserving of survival than giant reptiles [^Rorty2006idealizations:334].  

But still the problems linger.  If the normative principles of democracy can only be justified from within the actual practice itself, what form could these justifications take?  Rorty suggests substituting external foundations with the idea that what makes us special is "our ability feel for, cherish, and trust people very different from ourselves" [^Rorty2006idealizations:335] but this appears to be nothing more than a foundationalist claim about human nature.  Even if we limit our justifications to _more of this practice and less of that_, we must still justify _these_ claims somehow if we ever want to make normative comparisons - _why_ more of this practice is better than less of that one.  If we can't justify one form of democracy over another, then we can't justify some democracy over some non-democracy. Anti-foundationalism fails to allow this comparison.

My hope, or perhaps naive optimism, is that in the course of the next few years research I can identify a different justificatory account of democracy that avoids failing foul of these dilemmas.  My intuition is that democracy can be built upon foundations, but foundations that are internal to democracy itself. Much like recursive formula or mathematical induction, democratic theory will then be able to pick itself up by its own bootstraps. Call this non-foundationalism. 

## Democracy is not Democratic

How does a people decide exactly who should be included amongst the people? The democratic method would be to vote on the matter but then who should vote? It can’t be _the people_ because who _the people_ are is only determined after the vote has been tallied.  How does a people decide the boundaries of the political and the demarcation of personal from collective decisions? Again, voting can’t be the solution because limiting the domain of the political via collective decision is itself a political action, while voting to increase the political makes vacuous the whole notion of the personal.  How does a people agree to an electoral system when the choice of electoral system itself requires agreement on an earlier electoral system in order for the choice to be democratic? 

These democratic dilemmas form part of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox - the inability of democratic systems to justify themselves democratically. In each case, a democratic solution seems impossible without either unanimous agreement or resort to non-democratic means, and neither of these solutions is attractive to a democrat.  Unanimous, collective agreement is both practically unlikely and indistinguishable from unanimous non-collective non-binding agreement, making the state no different from anarchy. Non-democratic justifications on the other hand, if substantive enough, threaten to undermine accounts of democratic legitimacy and tempt us to reject democracy in favour of these prior non-democratic ideals.

For the rest of this paper, I'm going to defend the paradoxical thesis that democracy is not democratic. Its establishment, alteration and operation all require justificatory recourse to non-democratic ideals, and any substantively non-democratic system cannot be justified as being democratic.  Or perhaps it can be if we reject contemporary accounts of democracy in favour of something else entirely.  I'm not sure yet and I still have considerable work to do before I'm confident supporting these claims either way.

### The Bootstrap Paradox

My core argument can be stated as follows:

1. A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.
2. A substantive number of these systems & procedures cannot be called democratic by any coherent interpretations of the term.
3. Democracy therefore, cannot be justifiably labelled democratic.

Of course, this paradox only bites if the premises are true.  Like many paradoxes it is possible, likely even, that the Bootstrap Paradox is little more than invalid deduction camouflaged by semantic equivocation.  So considerable effort will need to be spent clarifying exactly what _democracy_ means according to contemporary accounts of it.  Not only has democracy come to represent a range of _ideals_ such as freedom, equality and popular sovereignty, it has also been variously interpreted as a _system_ which legitimates authority, distributes power, aggregates preferences, and creates knowledge.  These interpretations of democracy then determine and constrain the normative justifications of contemporary accounts of democracy.  This is the focus of Part One of my thesis.  

In Part Two, I will be examining a number of problems that lie at the foundations of democratic theory.  How can a people define itself in a way that doesn't undermine the legitimacy of the state?  Are coherent democratic process for succession or unification even possible? How can a constitution be created and ratified democratically? How can the contested limits of liberalism be determined democratically without undermining liberalism itself?  These dilemma show that no extant account of democracy is able to provide sufficient normative justifications for the meta-processes, such as demarkation, creation, and alteration, required for the operation of the state.  And if sufficiently many processes and procedures of a system of government are not democratic, then that system cannot justifiably be called democratic.

Part Three will, or at least I hope it will, provide some possible solutions the problems I have just raised.  Currently, my thoughts on this are too underdeveloped to present anything of note, other than my aim to use an inductive or recursive processes to bootstrap my account of democracy.  What follows is a brief summary of Parts One and Two.

## What Democracy?

_Democracy_ in modern parlance, seems to have become a largely vacuous term, a simple substitute for vague, positive feelings towards one form of government or another.  The term has become synonymous with notions of equality and popular sovereignty, justice and rule of law, voting and majoritarianism, liberalism and freedom; yet many of these values conflict and some necessarily so.  And yet when a term means everything, it means nothing.  The recent debate on compulsory voting in Australia is illustrative.  Liberal Senator Nick Minchin has claimed that "compulsory voting is an infringement of the democratic rights of Australians" [^2] while Victorian Liberal MP Josh Frydenberg praises it as "a pillar of democracy"[^3].  When the one proposal can be simultaneously labelled both democratic and undemocratic, by members of the same party even, then it is clear the term is too vague to be a useful tool of analysis. 

But before we examine what theorists take democracy to mean, ...

- Our first question is does democracy --> democratic or democratic --> democracy?
- Democracy is something that is democratic

### Ideals

Etymology suggests we start at Athens. Herodotus seems to have been the first to coin the term _demokratia_ (δημοκρατία) to denote popular sovereignty or rule by the people [^isakan2011:22].  Popular sovereignty is typically thought to mean rule _of_ the people, _for_ the people, and _by_ the people.  But rule _of_ the people implies the demos as the source of sovereignty, rule _by_ the people implies a active role for the citizen in the decision making process, a form of direct and participatory democracy, while rule _for_ the people suggests that their will and interest is to a large degree realised into law. 

Yet these characteristics seem largely absent from contemporary democratic states.  Democracy has become synonymous with representational democracy and few states integrate significant levels of referenda and plebiscite into the political process.  There is little active role for the citizen outside of elections while popular participatory mechanisms such as forums rarely if ever wield formal power.  Finally, special interest groups and lobbyists exercise overwhelming influence on the political agenda through what Lawrence Lessig calls dependence corruption [^lessig2011], whereby public debate is restricted to only those issues successfully contested amongst large doners.

Voting is often thought to be the most democratic method of making collective decisions but it is neither a necessary, nor sufficient element of democracy.  Voting was only a minor one minor mechanism of early democracies with elections in Athens were overwhelmingly made sortition or lot, with voting limited to ......... Sortition is compatible with political equality 

Many non-democratic systems also widely employ voting...... 

- Voting seems synonymous but is neither necessary nor sufficient. Sortition, Soviet, monitory, psephocracy
- Democratic totalitarianism, freedom, liberalism, justice
- Autonomy
- Conflicting relations between these concepts...The constraints of liberalism are explicit in their intention to limit popular sovereignty.

### Systems

- aggregating preferences - social choice
- knowledge creation 
- 

### Justifications

- what are we justifying - authority & obligation - particularism - why this state and not another
- epistemic proceduralism  - 
- consent
- affect


## Problems and Paradoxes

A range of paradoxes and problems lie at the foundations of democratic theory, problems that collectively I call the Bootstrap Paradox.

Outline:

- the boundary problem
- the constitution paradox
- the limits of liberalism
- voting on voting


### Boundaries

	"Political Philosophers can only begin once the Generals are finished."

- The boundary problem is as simple as it is fatal to democracies claim to instrumental justifications.
- It can be outlined as:

	1.	Democracy makes claims of legitimacy. 
	
	2. 	But the 'who' in any democracy determines the 'what'. 
	
	3.	There is no current account that legitimates the people forming process.  
	
	4.	Democracy therefore, cannot claim any legitimate claims for the obedience of its subjects.

History

- Shouldn't a problem this significant have been extensively addressed in the literature?
- Dahl ([1970][dahl1970]) described it as a 'curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem'
- Whelan ([1983][whelan1983]) provides the first serious (and only) analysis of the problem and examines the sparsity of potential solutions
- Dahl ([1989][dahl1989]) returns again to the issue he calls 'the problem of constituting the unit' and  'the problem of inclusion'
- Arrhenius ([2005][arrhenius2005]) makes an unsuccessful attempt to solve the problem by invoking the all-affected principle
- Goodin ([2007][goodin2007]) commits himself to an acknowledged unworkable enfranchisement of all affected interests.
- Erman ([2011][erman2011]) offers a discourse-theoretical approach to the problem with the equal-influence principle
- Song ([2012][song2012]) Asks why the demos should be bounded by the state

Democracy and Authority
-----------------------

- accounts of political authority
- right to rule
- justified coercion
- imposition of duties

- what is so special about democracy?


Who Determines What
-------------------



An Unsolved Problem
-------------------

- democracy can't solve the problem internally
	- the question of who is logically prior to what
	- an infinite regress of voting on who votes
- all-affected principle has a strong prima facie case
	- who is affected is determined by the outcome
	- but the outcome is affected by who gets to vote
	- who is potentially affected is determined by who poses the question
	- who can pose the question has its own boundary problem
	- degree of affect also complicates the issue
	- to what extent must I be affected to have a say?
	- we'd need different jurisdictions for each issue
	- the only solution is to enfranchise all interests
	- but enfranchising someone who isn't affected reduces my autonomy just as much as disenfranchising me when I am affected.
	- the affect principle requires enfranchisement of all-and-only-affected interests
	- this reintroduces the problem of degree of affect and removes the global solution
- nationality and cultural salience provide another possibility
	- nationality follows boarders as much as boarders follow nations
	- there is no objective criteria for cultural salience
	- linguist and historical salience seem bad criteria for determining non-linguist/cultural issues
- geographic and economic features seem to delimit societies.
