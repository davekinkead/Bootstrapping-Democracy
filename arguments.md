This is an ever evolving outline of the argument structure of my thesis _Bootstrapping Democracy_.  The question I am attempting to address is this:

> How do the existential issues of democratic inclusion, scope, and realisation affect justifications of democratic authority?

The argument takes the form of a series of premise claims supporting some concluding claim.  Each premise is linked to roughly 500-1000 words of justificatory text, and may itself be the conclusion of early premises, making the whole thing some kind of argument web.

The evolution of this document will be non-linear.  Claims will be added in any order based on the random state of my thoughts at any given time.  Once freed from their cognitive prison, these draft thoughts can be later polished into chapters.


1. [If a political theory is justified, then it must be supported by a coherent set of normative claims](thoughts/justified-political-theories-are-coherent-normative-claims.md)

    1. Political theories can either be justified or unjustified

    2. Political theories can either be accepted or rejected

    3. If a political theory is justified, then it must be supported by a coherent argument of normative claims.

    4. If a political theory is accepted but not justified, then it is only rationalised
    
2. Democracy cannot be supported by a coherent argument of normative claims

    1. The problem of people render difference making accounts incoherent
    
        1. Democracy must answer the question of inclusion
        
        3. Accounts of inclusion must be compatible with accounts of authority
        
        2. The question of inclusion cannot be answered democratically
        
        4. Non-democratic accounts of inclusion are not compatible with some accounts of authority
        
        5. Some accounts of authority can't be justified
    
    2. The paradoxes of procedures render procedural accounts incoherent
    
    3. The limits of liberalism render substantive liberal accounts incoherent
    
        1. Democracy requires constraints to its power
        
        2. Liberalism give democracy much of its value
        
        3. Liberalism requires some rights to be priorities over others
        
        4. Liberalism entails pluralist conceptions of which rights should be pluralised
        
        5. Liberalism's content must be reconciled
        
        6. Liberalism's content cannot be reconciled democratically
        
        7. Liberalism's content cannot be reconciled liberally
        
        8. Liberalism cannot provide the constraint democracy requires of it

3. Democracy cannot be justified

    7. But democracy is accepted by many

    8. Democracy can only be rationalised
