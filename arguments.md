# Argument Structure

The central thesis of my doctoral project is that democratic authority cannot be justified.  More specifically, I am going to argue that because of our inability to adequately answer key questions relating to the existential nature of democracy, any reasons we may give in favour of the normative legitimacy of democratic authority are merely post hoc rationalisations of particular power structures.

My primary research question then is this:

> How do the existential issues of democratic inclusion, scope, realisation, and necessity affect justifications of democratic authority?


Much of this argument will obviously hinge on what it means for something to be justified so I will devote an entire chapter to this issue. To fix meanings for now however, lets examine some typically definitions: 

- justify: to show or prove to be right or reasonable.

- rationalise: to attempt to explain or justify (one's own or another's behaviour or attitude) with logical, plausible reasons, even if these are not true or appropriate.

The conception of justification I will be advancing then, is one concerning correctness and coherence.  Rationalisations on the other hand will lack this correctness or coherence.


So the basic logical structure of my argument can be summarised thusly:

1. If democratic authority is to be legitimate, then it must be justifiable,

2. Democratic authority can't be justifiable,

3. Therefore democratic authority can't be legitimate.


Lets explore this argument in more detail...


## If democratic authority is to be legitimate, then it must be justifiable

The opening chapters of my dissertation focus on this conditional claim.  In chapter two, I examine the history of democracy and accounts of democratic authority.  With the aid of historical and linguistic analysis, I document a taxonomy of political forms and advance a minimalist conception of democracy.  To this, a develop and apply a rich taxonomy of democratic predicates that allows for a more accurate understanding and discourse about democracy.

In _Legitimacy & Justification_, I explore the linkage between accounts of democratic authority and political justification.  After reviewing the literature on political epistemology, I advance the claim that any justification of political authority must satisfy X key requirements: coherence, strict consistency, ??? ....

Public justification & PR Liberalism acknowledge that we may have different reasons for acquiescing. That is not my concern.  Rather, I am concerned with the minimal epistemic standards for holding these reasons - and my later claim will be that democratic theory cannot even provide these.


## Democratic authority can't be justifiable


### The Problem of the people

Justifications of democracy that are influenced by inclusion cannot be coherent.



## Democratic authority can't be legitimate

All political order requires the willing compliance or at least the acquiescence of sufficiently many of those subjected to it.  If enough people reject the demands of those claiming authority, that authority can no longer be exercised because policing and enforcement become too expensive.  

A subject's acquiescence might be motivated by prudential or moral reasoning.  Threat of violence, reward, or even social inertia might be sufficient grounds for compliance and obedience to an authority in singular cases but insufficient for sustained political order.  For this, different reasoning is necessary to show subjects why that have moral reasons to obey.  It is to these latter reasons that my argument is addressed.

A key project of political philosophy is to justify that political order. Political philosophers do this by advancing accounts of political legitimacy - the specification of the conditions under which political order (_de facto_) political authority) becomes legitimate (_de jure_ political authority).  In other words, when do we have moral obligations to _this_ authority.

Epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified belief.  To be labelled knowledge , beliefs must meet certain epistemic standards.  So too for the reasons to obey that subjects acquiesces to.  A subject may acquiesce for good reasons or poor reasons.  Those reasons may be coherent or incoherent, strong or weak. Call the standards applied to justifications for acquiescence _political epistemology_.

Epistemology: the study of knowledge and justified belief.
    - Political Epistemology: the study of normative political belief.

1. [If a political theory is justified, then it must be supported by a coherent set of normative claims](thoughts/justified-political-theories-are-coherent-normative-claims.md)

    1. Political theories can either be justified or unjustified

    2. Political theories can either be accepted or rejected

    3. If a political theory is justified, then it must be supported by a coherent argument of normative claims.

    4. If a political theory is accepted but not justified, then it is only rationalised
    
2. Democracy cannot be supported by a coherent argument of normative claims

    1. The problem of people render difference making accounts incoherent
    
        1. Democracy must answer the question of inclusion
        
        3. Accounts of inclusion must be compatible with accounts of authority
        
        2. The question of inclusion cannot be answered democratically
        
        4. Non-democratic accounts of inclusion are not compatible with some accounts of authority
        
        5. Some accounts of authority can't be justified
    
    2. The paradoxes of procedures render procedural accounts incoherent
    
    3. The limits of liberalism render substantive liberal accounts incoherent
    
        1. Democracy requires constraints to its power
        
        2. Liberalism give democracy much of its value
        
        3. Liberalism requires some rights to be priorities over others
        
        4. Liberalism entails pluralist conceptions of which rights should be pluralised
        
        5. Liberalism's content must be reconciled
        
        6. Liberalism's content cannot be reconciled democratically
        
        7. Liberalism's content cannot be reconciled liberally
        
        8. Liberalism cannot provide the constraint democracy requires of it

3. Democracy cannot be justified

    7. But democracy is accepted by many

    8. Democracy can only be rationalised
