Some questions that I need to explore in much more detail.....

What are the characteristics of a collective decision?  What are its constituent parts? What makes this issue a political one?

How do we justify national or intra-national jurisdictions and boundaries?  Is there anything more than historical accident?  Why can't we form supra-national jurisdictions?

What justifies a particular conception of democracy? On what grounds are liberal vs republican interpretations based?
