Does Democracy need the Vote?

For most people, democracy is synonymous with voting.  Its easy to see why as almost every modern democratic state uses popular elections for determining at least a majority of their executive and legislative branches.  But is voting actually necessary for a government to call its self democratic?

The answer to this is, surprisingly, no.  Voting is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition of democracy.

Without trying to define my way to a conclusion a priori, voting does not feature as a constitutive element of democracy.  Tom Christiano provides a good definition...http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democracy/

"a method of group decision making characterized by a kind of equality among the participants at an essential stage of the collective decision making"

Etymologically speaking, the word 'democracy' stems from the Greek 'demos' (the common people) + 'kratos' (strength & rule).  The constitutive elements are therefore collective decision making and political equality.  Voting does not figure.

But is this characterisation of democracy congruent with our political intuitions.  Most people would agree that voting is not a sufficient element of democracy.  There a many examples of governments elected by popular vote that we would be struggle to call democratic.

In the Soviet Union, government was chosen through a form of delegated voting.  Delegates for local councils or 'Soviets' were chosen by popular election with universal suffrage.  Local soviets voted for district soviets, district soviets for regional ones, and regional for national, the 'Supreme Soviet'.  Similar 'elections' occur in many other states [http://www.freedomhouse.org] such as China, North Korea and Iran.

An immediate objection is that soviet elections were not free and fair.  And its certainly true that the USSR was a one party state where only candidates from the communist party could run for office yet compare the affect of this with national elections in the United States.  Nominally, any soviet citizen could be nominated (if they were members of the party) which is true of the US (who can also run as independents).  Yet in reality, significant patronage from entrenched elites was required.  Sadly this is also the case in the USA.  Almost no independents have been elected to national office in the US.  There hasn't been an independent president since George Washington and of the handful of independent congressmen from the last 50 years, almost all were first elected as members of parties.  The reality of US elections today is they can only be won with massive amounts of campaign finance and party patronage, effectively disenfranchising the vast majority of the population from ever contesting office.

Another objection to the Soviet comparison is that after the local soviet level, the general population never voted directly for the Supreme Soviet.  Again however, this situation is almost identical to the US.  Voters in the Presidential election do not vote for either candidate.  Instead they vote for electoral college electors who chosen by their respective parties and then vote en block as a state for their presidential candidate.

More controversial is the claim that voting isn't necessary for democracy.

Voting is only constitutive of democracy when it fulfils the requirement of political equality.
