Thesis: Simulation-as-argument extends the boundaries of what is knowable in philosophy


- Philosophy is a method of inquiry to generate new knowledge

  - There are many ways this can be done via analysis, thought experiment, logic, dialectic

  - these are all really just flavours of argumentation - the giving of reasons to support other claims.

- What is knowable in philosophy is limited to the extent that we have confidence that our conclusions cogently follow from our premises.

  - we can know that our premises are true, and our inferences are valid

  - the skeptic objects that ....???
  - how do we overcome that ???

  - Even when ignoring skeptical concers, knowledge can be limited in certain domains due to complexity, inaccessability, and/or intractability.

  - Computation and computer simulation are ways of generating knowledge.
    
    - Simulation can tell us what follows from axioms

    - how does simulation address these concerns???

  - Computer simulation, as used in philosophy, has serious epistemic problems

    - often, the code that runs the simulation is not available.

    - when it is, it is used as exogenously - as evidence for supporting claims within an argument. 

  - It's possible to use simulation in a way that overcomes these problems while increasing the rational persuasibilty of arguments.

    - embedding code within 

- Simulation-as-argument extends the boundaries of our confidence into domains too complex or intractable for traditional analysis and argument.
