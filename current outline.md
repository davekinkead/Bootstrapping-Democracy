# A dot point outline of my thesis

Simulation-as-argument is a computational approach to philosophy that uses computer code embedded within written scholarship to enhance the inferential support of traditional argumentation.





## Thesis options  

  1. Simulation-as-argument extends the boundaries of what is knowable in philosophy
  2. Simulation-as-argument extends the methodological tool kit of philosophy

## Question to address

  - how exactly does simulation-as-argument do more than extant simulation in philosophy?

CH1 Intro


CH2 Philosophy & Computing

  1. History of computing in philosophy
  3. Digital philosophy vs computational philosophy
  4. Logic provers
  5. Data mining
  6. Computer simulation
  7. Epsitemic strengths of simulation
    - demonstrate simulation's value in problem domains characterised by complexity, analytic intractibility, & limited accessability
  8. Epistemic weaknesses of simulation
    - deomonstrate simulation's limitations wrt reliability and reproducability 

CH3 Two types of scholarship

  1. Science goes like this
  2. Philosophy goes like this
  3. the distinction is the epistemic source (internal vs external)
  4. simulation in philosophy is like simluation in science
  5. simulation this way isnt as _philosophical_ as it could be 


CH4 Simulation as Argument

  2. Making simulation more _philosophischer-art_ requires more focus on argumentation
  3. Begin with plain text
    - plain text is the base format for writen scholarship and code
  4. Use literate programming
    - literate programming is a method of writing code that inverts the traditional relationship between code and comments
  5. Transpile for purpose
    - compile for code
    - compile for scholarship

## Objective

To have simulation-as-argument accepted as an acceptable method of philosophical scholarship.

## Thesis 

Simulation-as-argument extends the boundaries of what is knowable in philosophy

## Steps in the argument

  1. There are two archeptypes of scholarship 
    - experimental and theoretical
    - philosophical scholarship is theoretical

  2. These archetypes have different epistemic qualities
    - experimental scholarship relies on testimony not independently knowable

  3. Philosophical scholarship is almost always theoretical
    - the use of argument and non-empiric method is a defining characteristic

  4. Computer simulation in philosophy is used experimentally
    - computer simulation also relies on testimony not independently knowable 

  5. The testimonial use of simulation is more problematic than experiment
    - computer simulation has no real constraints
    - computer simulation is highly sensitive to parameterisation

  1. we don't need to use simluation in this way

  1. Language as logic
    - we use natural language to 
    - why do we reason???
    - what does it mean to reason???

  1. Code is logic
    - code was first mechanical (Babbage's Engines, Turing's Bombe)
  


    - what is code
    - what is abstraction
    - what is inference







- Philosophy is a method of inquiry to generate new knowledge

  - There are many ways this can be done via analysis, thought experiment, logic, dialectic

  - these are all really just flavours of argumentation - the giving of reasons to support other claims.

- What is knowable in philosophy is limited to the extent that we have confidence that our conclusions cogently follow from our premises.

  - we can know that our premises are true, and our inferences are valid

  - the skeptic objects that ....???
  - how do we overcome that ???

  - Even when ignoring skeptical concers, knowledge can be limited in certain domains due to complexity, inaccessability, and/or intractability.

  - Computation and computer simulation are ways of generating knowledge.
    
    - Simulation can tell us what follows from axioms

    - how does simulation address these concerns???

  - Computer simulation, as used in philosophy, has serious epistemic problems

    - often, the code that runs the simulation is not available.

    - when it is, it is used as exogenously - as evidence for supporting claims within an argument. 

  - It's possible to use simulation in a way that overcomes these problems while increasing the rational persuasibilty of arguments.

    - embedding code in writing

    - fixing the reproduction problem
      - why this is different to apendix

    - how reasoning with code

    - probabilistic proof

    - the epistemic shift from testimony to inference

    - 


- Simulation-as-argument extends the boundaries of our confidence into domains too complex or intractable for traditional analysis and argument.
