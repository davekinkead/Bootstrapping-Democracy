You call this a Democracy?

Thesis: we need to be clear about democracy if our dialog is to be meaningful

Democracy is the worst form of government, execpt for all the others we've tried from time to time[^1]. It's both the road to socialism[^5] and path to liberty[^6].  It's the process by which the people are free to choose the person who will get the blame[^2], and the device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve[^3]. Our politicians lob the accusatives 'democratic' and 'undemocratic' at the same proposal simultainiously[^7], while polticial theorists now talk of 'democratising democracy'[^8]. What ever it is, 'democracy' means many things to many people.  

And yet as Robert Dahl notes, when a term means everything, it means nothing. 'Democratic' has become the catch all term of modern politics, the rallying cry for some vague notion of good government.  To argue today that a policy is bad because it's undemocratic is to say nothing more than it is bad because it is bad... 

We need to get clear about what we mean when we talk about democracy to avoid shouting past each other...

Linguistics don't offer us much of a solution.  Democracy is derived from the Greek
