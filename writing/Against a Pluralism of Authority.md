#Against a Pluralism of Authority

- chritiano's claim
- the problems with pluralism
	 - conflation
	 - justifications of one form applied to another
	 - some accounts just don't make sense
- dimensions of authority
	- theoretical vs practical
	- authority vs power
	- normative vs descriptive, 
	- de jure vs de facto
	- absolute vs limited
	- legislative vs judicial vs executive vs administrative.
	- legitimate coercion vs imposition of duties vs right to rule
	- prototypical conceptions; expert, moral...
- towards a singular account
	- accounts of authority and justifications of authority
	- authority is giving reasons
	- but competency is required
	- accounts of authority & justifications of power

It is not a useful aim of philosophers or political thinkers to determine which account of political authority is the right one. Or at least so says Tom Christiano. 

But Tom is wrong.  Determining which account of authority is the right or appropriate one is a critical aim of political philosophy.  Without doing so, we are condemned to the conflation of the very terms and ideas which we endeavour to unpack and explain; we can all too easily fail prey to fallaciously applying the justification of one conception of authority to another; or some of our accounts may be just plain wrong.

Example of conflation

Conceptions of authority can be broadly pigeonholed to accounts concerning the legitimacy of coercion, the imposition of duties upon others, or the right to rule {cite Christiano}.

---

Contemporary accounts of authority have framed the issue from a variety of perspectives. First, there is the distinction between theoretical and practical authority.  The former gives us reasons to believe while the latter gives us reasons to act. {example} 

Another distinction is that between power and authority. {example}

Authority can also be thought of in a description or normative sense, what Wolff {cite} describes as *de facto* and *de jure* authority. {example}

So we are at a crossroad.  We can either accept a pluralism of accounts of authority and the associated conflict of this approach, or we can attempt to reconcile the varying …….  

I choose the latter.

Authorities give reasons.  Reasons to do, to be, to believe, and to act.  The Pope proclaims the moral impermissibility of same sex relations; Parliament commands us to pay taxes; the Supreme Court declares flag burning a constitutional right.  

Yet the giving of reasons alone is not sufficient to be an authority.  The rouge offers us our money or our life; the infomercial invites us to order now to receive a free set of steak knives; the t-shirt tells us don't worry be happy.  Anyone, or anything, can give reasons to think or act but authority requires something more.  It requires sufficient competence relating to those reasons.

	Reasons from authorities are also content independent.  Homosexuality is a sin according to the church, simple because the Pope made it so.

So we accept the theoretical authority of an expert when we recognise their superior competency in some field.  We accept moral authority of the Pope if we believe he has some superior connection to a deity.  

- authority as superior competence
- is right to rule anything more than permissible coercion and imposition of duties?
- does permissibility of coercion encompass authority?


We ought believe the expert's advice, simply because she is an expert and we are not.



Authority is simply the giving of reasons, whilst having sufficient competency for giving those reasons.
