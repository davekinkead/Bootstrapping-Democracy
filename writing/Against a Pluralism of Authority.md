It is not a useful aim of philosophers or political thinkers to determine which account of political authority is the right one. Or at least so says Tom Christiano.[^1]

But Tom is wrong.  Determining which account of authority is the right or appropriate one is a critical aim of political philosophy.  Without doing so, we are condemned to the conflation of the very terms and ideas which we endeavour to unpack and explain; we can all too easily fail prey to fallaciously applying the justification of one conception of authority to a differing instance of another; and of course, some of our accounts may be just plain wrong.

Example of conflation

Conceptions of authority can be broadly pigeonholed to accounts concerning the legitimacy of coercion, the imposition of duties upon others, or the right to rule {cite Christiano}.

Contemporary accounts of authority have framed the issue from a variety of perspectives. First, there is the distinction between theoretical and practical authority.  The former gives us reasons to believe while the latter gives us reasons to act. When the physicist tells us that the universe is expanding because the further a galaxy is from us, the faster is it moving away from us, he gives us a reason to believe.  When the police officer instructs to step out of the vehicle, he gives us a reason to act.  Typical accounts of political authority hold that the two are distinct (cf Hurd for a notable exception) although I will argue against this later.

Another distinction is that between power and authority. Power can be thought of as simply the ability to realise one's objectives, and can manifest itself as either soft, i.e. persuasive, or hard, i.e. backed by threat of force.  An salesperson may realise her goals through the skilled use of psychology and rhetoric while a criminal may achieve his ends via force or threat thereof; yet in neither of these instances, would we claim that they have authority over us.  

But authority without power is a largely vacuous concept.  An exiled prince may claim to the the rightful heir to his estranged kingdom, yet without the ability to realise his will, he can be describes at best as an authority in name only.  Authority is more than power, but former requires the latter.  Various drug cartels may exercise their power of large swathes of Latin America without any authority, yet when the state cannot effectively maintain public order it has lost its authority regardless of its normative claim to it.

Authority can also be thought of in a description or normative sense, what Wolff [^2] describes as *de facto* and *de jure* authority. De facto authority occurs whenever (sufficient) people acknowledged it to exist.  The state commands, people comply because it is the state, therefore the state has de facto authority.  De jure authority however, only occurs when we have legitimate reasons for obeying.  Whilst Hobbes may have claimed that the ability to rule gave the Prince the right to rule, most conceptions of authority recognise this descriptive/normative distinction and the major project of political philosophy seems to be eliciting this dichotomy and outlining the conditions of when we ought obey.

A further dimension to authority is

So we are at a crossroad.  We can either accept a pluralism of accounts of authority and the associated conflict of this approach, or we can attempt to reconcile the varying conceptions of authority into a single, comprehensive account.  I choose the latter.

In order to avoid the charge of defining my way axiomatically to my conclusions, it is necessary to state the conditions under which my account will failâ€¦..

Prototypical examples of authority: the expert, the pope, the courts, the state. 

Difference between accounts of authority and justifications of authority

---

Authorities give reasons.  Reasons to do, to be, to believe, and to act.  The Pope proclaims the moral impermissibility of same sex relations; Parliament commands us to pay taxes; the Supreme Court declares flag burning a constitutional right.  

Yet the giving of reasons alone is not sufficient to be an authority.  The rouge offers us our money or our life; the infomercial invites us to order now to receive a free set of steak knives; the t-shirt tells us don't worry be happy.  Anyone, or anything, can give reasons to think or act but authority requires something more.  

Authority requires sufficient competence relating to the reasons it gives.  We accept an authority because it is in someway, more competent than we are.

Our grounds for accepting an authority relate to the superior competence of the authority, not to the reasons themselves.

This is different from the notion of content independence.  

So we accept the theoretical authority of an expert when we recognise their superior competency in some field.  We accept moral authority of the Pope if we believe he has some superior connection to a deity.  

- authority as superior competence
- is right to rule anything more than permissible coercion and imposition of duties?
- does permissibility of coercion encompass authority?


We ought believe the expert's advice, simply because she is an expert and we are not.



Authority is simply the giving of reasons, whilst having sufficient competency for giving those reasons.
