# Arse About Face Liberalism

---

Introduction (250)

In _A Theory of Justice_, Rawls outlines his account for what a just state should be (250)

But it had problems - stability over time (500)

In _Political Liberalism_, he attempted to solve these problems by using public reason (250)

But his public reason has problems (500)

Other theorists attempted to improve upon Rawls (250)

They also have problems (250)

These problems can be solved by making boundaries the result of overlapping consensus  (750)

What are objections to this? (750)

Conclusion (250)

## Arse About Face

**Adjective, Adverb**

_(idiomatic, UK, Australia)_

1.	In a manner that is opposite to or the reverse of the way it should be, backwards.
2.	Arranged in a confused or haphazard way; muddled.

I should probably start with a clarification of terms for anyone not yet blessed by their exposure to the linguistic beauty that is Australian slang.  _Arse-about-face_ is an anglo-australian colloquialism that means to get things backwards.  

As in, "that Rawls fella has got this whole political liberalism thing arse about face".

---

The argument I will be forwarding today is that liberalism get things backwards.  It's _Skew If_ to borrow another Australian term of art.

More specifically though, I'm going to defend the thesis that that the project of political liberalism approaches the problem of stability within liberal democratic regimes the wrong way.  That hopes of stable liberal democratic regimes over time given the inevitability of reasonable pluralism are a lost cause.

So rather than attempt to monkey patch political liberalism onto a pluralist polity of fixed boundaries, I'm going to argue we should instead use the idea of an overlapping consensus to define the very boundaries of our political associations themselves.  By reconceptualising who is included within a polity as endogenous variable of liberal analysis, we can solve the problem of stability over time.

---

In Part One of this paper, I'm going to briefly outline problem that Rawls hoped _Political Liberalism_ would address.  I'll show why Rawls was justifiably concerned about the stability of liberal regimes in the face of plurality, before showing why his and subsequent accounts of political liberalism have failed to adequately address his concerns.

In Part Two, I'll argue why we should approach the problem of liberalism in the face of diversity from a different dimension.  I'll show that.....

While in Part Three, I'll address weaknesses and likely objections to my account.


## Rawls' Problem

In _A Theory of Justice_, Rawls tried to answer the question of what is the most appropriate way of specifying fair terms of cooperation within a society. It was an attempt to reconcile the conflicting requirements of liberty and equality in a way that utilitarianism had been unable to do.

His answer was _Justice as Fairness_, and its derivative principles of _Liberty_ and _Difference_, the realisation of which would result in an egalitarian, property-owning liberal democracy.

---

Yet as Rawls himself acknowledged, his account had a major flaw.  Much of _A Theory_ was predicated on a Kantian conception of liberalism.  But realising a conception of political justice predicated upon a widely accepted comprehensive conception of the good is both highly unlikely and inherently unstable.

From a political-historical perspective, the spontaneous emergence of widespread comprehensive liberal values within a society appears to be highly unlikely.  Broad endorsement of a comprehensive liberal doctrine is a relatively recent phenomenon within the West, and can be seen as a gradual evolution of thought and value since the enlightenment, shaped by political institutions, culture and social norms.  It is not something that just happens overnight or arrives at the doorstep one morning.

Yet contemporary history demonstrates the fragility of comprehensive liberal doctrines even within constitutionally liberal regimes.  The rise of European fascism in the 1930s, 1960s, and today the emergence of parties like Golden Dawn in Greece, are just a few examples of how the evolution of comprehensive liberalism is not a monotonic, or unidirectional, process.

---

But liberalism itself is inherently unstable.  As a doctrine of liberty that respects, enables, and promotes a plurality of views politically, philosophically, and morally, liberalism sows the seeds of its own destruction.  

Liberal regimes lead to not just a diversity of competing liberal conceptions of the good, but also of opposing and irreconcilable beliefs, illiberal yet still perfectly reasonable; something Rawls saw as the "inevitable long run result of the powers of human reason at work within the background of enduring free institutions" [^rawls1996:4].

More problematically, it seems that many of the most important issues - theology, science, the good - are the most intractable, leading Rawls to worry that "we should find it remarkable that, so deeply opposed in these ways, just cooperation among free and equal citizens is possible at all" [^rawls1996:4]

Plurality within liberal democracies "is not a mere historical condition that may soon pass ways; it is a permanent feature of the public culture of democracy." [^ralws1996:36]

---

So the idea of _Justice as Fairness_ as outlined in the _Theory_, was predicated on a stable liberal democratic regime, itself based upon a  Kantian inspired comprehensive liberalism.  The result of this however, would be reasonable pluralism, including reasonable illiberal doctrines.  

It was, Rawls' notes, reliant on a "premise the realisation of which it's principles of justice ruled out" [^ralws1996:xvi]

To try an sustain a liberal, or any for that matter, regime based on a comprehensive moral doctrine could therefore "be maintained only by the oppressive use of state power" [^ralws1996:37], something Rawls christened the _Fact of Oppression_

---

## Public Reason

To reconcile liberalism with stability over time, Rawls proposed an account of _Political Liberalism_.  Political liberalism differed from comprehensive forms of liberalism in its scope and justification.

Much of the normative work of of this account is done by the notion of a _political conception of justice_, a freestanding moral doctrine directed at society's basic political institutions, informed by, yet prior to, individual comprehensive conceptions of justice.

Here, a society's collective political conception of justice is derived by the _Idea of an Overlapping Consensus_ and the _Idea of Public Reason_.

---

The _Idea of Public Reason_ provides the criteria for including and evaluating political discourse.  Public reasons are, rather tautologically, public.  They are not simply the public statement of private reasons but rather the public statement of reasons that  1) other reasonable citizens would understand, 2) we ourselves would accept, 3) we reasonably think others would reasonably accept. [^rawls1997:771]

It is this expectation of reasonable acceptance, governed by the criteria of reciprocity and duty of civility, that imbues laws developed in this way with legitimacy.

---

The _Idea of An Overlapping Consensus_ then, is the mechanism for obtaining agreement amongst reasonable diversity... [Expand 250w]

## Brittleness

Rawls' _Political Liberalism_ has faced a number of criticisms in the decade since it was published [^quong2009:5] but I'm not going to focus on those today because it is my belief that even if they are adequately addressed, a more significant problem for public reason liberal accounts remains - something I describe as brittleness.

---

As Rawls demonstrated, the stability of a liberal democratic regime requires a sufficiently large overlapping consensus regarding the how the basic institutions of society ought best be organised. Constitutional or institutional matters that hold broad support are far more likely to secure the stability of a polity than when such matters are divisive.  

In our quest to avoid modus vivideni.....

There is an inevitable conflict then between the two sources of stability, which we can witness being played out in the debate between consensus and convergence views within public reason liberalism: The strength of commitment to ideals resulting from a consensus based on agreement for the _right_ reasons, and the breadth of commitment to those ideals resulting from a consensus based on agreement for _any_ reason.


---

On the one hand, consensus for the right reasons can be strengthened by limiting the criteria for reasonableness.

---

On the other, the breadth of support can be expanded by allowing consensus for any reasons (the convergence view).


## Boundaries

What type of stability are we talking about? - institutional

---

The boundaries of political associations within liberal theory have typically been taken to be exogenous to analysis.  Liberal theory focuses inward, to the rights, duties, and distribution of primary goods within a society.

In liberal theories with pre-political geneses such as Locke's, people "incorporate and make one body politic" by agreeing to the "bonds of civil society" ...  "This any number ... may do because it injures not the freedom of the rest" [^locke1690:8-96]

And liberal theories with societal geneses have a similar inward focus.  In _Theory_, Rawls begins with the idea of a society before examining how it ought be organised. In _Political Liberalism_, he makes this explicit: 

"that the basic structure is that of a closed society: that is, we are to regard it as self-contained and as having no relations with other societies." [^rawls1996:12]

--- 

The inward focus of political liberalism is driven not by theoretical necessity, but rather by simplicity.  As Rawls notes, it is an "abstraction, justified only because it enables us to focus on certain main questions free from distracting details." [^rawls1996:12] 

Of course, this is not to say that Rawls ignores outward relations between peoples. "At some point a political conception of justice must address just relations between peoples" [^ralws1996:12] something which he does address in _The Laws of Peoples_.

But Rawls is explicit that these outward relations are not governed by the same principles as inward ones.  In _Laws_ .....

---

His outward focused account of international relations, _The Laws of People_, while certainly inspired by liberal values, is not a liberal doctrine.  Rather, it concerns itself with the relations between what Rawls calls decent people.

The liberal theory that underpins _Theory_ and _Political Liberalism_ is expressly disavowed when focus is cast outwards.  Rawls denies that the Difference Principle applies between states and peoples, preferring a threshold based _Duty of Assistance_ owed by 'well-ordered peoples' to assist other societies to become part of the society of well-ordered peoples. [cite!]

He also denies requirements of equality...

---

Its easy to describe why this might be the case, why we typically take the units political association to be fixed and why the primacy of our focus is on relationship within that fixed entity.

- In The Law of Peoples,( Rawls aims to derive the laws to which well- ordered peoples would agree.
- Charles Beitz and Thomas Pogge have argued that liberty principle and difference principle from _Theory_ should apply to all people globally.
- Rawls rejects this as he argues different principles would be chosen by different peoples

---

So rather than attempt to cajole a conception of political liberalism upon a fixed polity divided by a pluralism of comprehensive doctrines, I propose a new account of how Rawls' problem can be solved - employ the idea of Overlapping Consensus as the determining criteria of the boundaries of our political associations.
