# Arse About Face Liberalism

Explain 'arse about face'

Thesis:  That accounts of political liberalism are self defeating when the boundaries of the polity are considered stable or exogenous to analysis.

## Part One - How it is self defeating

1. Liberalism tends towards instability. 

	- Liberalism permits and entails illiberal beliefs.
	- Introduce Rawls' problem - stable liberalism amongst reasonable pluralism.
	- Take it further - stable liberalism amongst unreasonable pluralism.

2. Political (Public Reason) Liberalism requires support from comprehensive liberal doctrines to be stable.

	- A modus vivendi is unstable because parties are not committed to liberal values.
	- Convergence accounts can't overcome modus vivendi instability. We need to know others are committed to liberalism.
	- Stable liberalism requires consensus.  We must be committed to liberal values for it to be stable.
	- But consensus requires shared liberal values which trump any conflicting comprehensive values.
	- Our comprehensive doctrines must either be subordinate to, or compatible with political liberalism.
	- Attempts to idealise 'reasonableness' simply import liberal values.

3. When the bounds of a liberal polity is fixed, then not all reasonable people will hold comprehensive liberal doctrines

	- From 1)

4. Therefore Political Liberalism is self defeating.

## Part Two - What to do about it 

1. Liberalism and boundaries

	- Liberalism's assumption of a polity.
	- Liberalism's neglect of the other.
	- The current sets of overlapping and divergent values.
	
2. Allow an overlapping consensus to define the boundaries of the polity.

3. With fluid boundaries, agreement rather than consensus is all that is necessary.

	- Convergence in fixed boundaries fails because we need to know others are committed to liberal values.
	- But with fluid boundaries, others don't need to be committed to liberal values.
	- Convergence is sufficient with fluid boundaries.
	
## Objections

1. Plausibility - States are here to stay.

	- Naturalistic fallacy.  
	- Static states are not necessary, they merely dominant political thought contingently.
	- We have injustice now, so why then put forward a theory of justice?

3. Threat of Balkanisation - Won't this lead to disintegration of societies

	- It will certainly lead to political decentralisation but not disintegration.
	- Static polities can only get consensus on a very narrow range of issues. (Range vs Coverage)
	- Fluid polities can achieve consensus a much broader range 

2. How do we deal with others

	- Same as now
	- Liberalism doesn't offer us much in this regard.
