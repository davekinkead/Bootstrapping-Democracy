Is Consent Enough?

Consent theorists typically hold consent as a necessary condition for political obligation but not all view it as sufficient. As Locke noted "acquiescence in, or even consent to, clearly unjust institutions does not give rise to obligations, â€¦ obligatory ties presuppose just institutions."

I will defend the thesis that Locke was wrong, and that consent is sufficient for political obligations, both for those that accept consent theory as well as those of supporting rival accounts of political obligation.

The Consent Argument

-	Some argument on how obligations are generated???
-	Consent is sufficient to generate political obligations.

Lockean Objection

-	Certain rights are natural and inalienable.
- 	Political obligations that violate those rights are non-bonding.
-	Consent is not sufficient to generate political obligation.

Lockean Objection Response

-	Consent involves the granting of rights one already has to another who does not.
-	If a right is inalienable, it cannot be assigned.
-	One can asset to obligations that may not bind but one cannot consent to them.
- 	The Lockean objection conflates consent with assent and is therefore unsound.

Non-Consent Theory Objections

Need to know

-	What makes an obligation binding?
