# Bootstrapping Democracy

### Three Minute Thesis

## Introduction

What's the difference between the government threatening you with jail if you don't pay your taxes, and a gunman threatening your life if you don't give him your wallet?  It might be sensible to obey both in order to avoid bad consequences but only can claim a _moral obligation_ to obey.

Now what if, rather than a gunman, it was Greenpeace threatening you? "Your money or your life, so we can save the whales."  Both groups might use your money for good, but simply doing good doesn't seem to be enough to justify coercive force.

A key project of political philosophy is to justify the _legitimate_ authority of some groups, but not others.  Because if we want to say that we have a _moral obligation_ to obey the laws of a properly elected democratic government, but not those of a tyrant, then we need an account of democratic legitimacy that adequately explains the difference between the two.

## Paradoxes

My thesis, Bootstrapping Democracy, examines the paradoxes that lie at the very foundations of democratic theory.  Paradoxes which seep up and undermine subsequent accounts of democratic legitimacy.

So far I've identified paradoxes relating the formation, inclusion, and bounding of democracies, at least one of which is present in every major account of democratic legitimacy.

Take procedural accounts of legitimacy for example.  According to many theorists, the thing that makes a government legitimate is that is elected in the proper manner, and that it follows the laws laid out in the constitution.

But then how can these laws be legitimately established in the first place?  because procedure is all that matters, how can that first law or constitution be legitimate, when no procedure yet exists?

## Thesis

This dilemma is just one of a number of problems that make up what I call the Bootstrap Paradox - the inability of democracy to justify its self without becoming entangled in a web of self referential circularity or reply on the crutches of non-democratic theory.

My aim is to develop an account of democratic legitimacy that avoids these problems by bootstrapping itself - by identifying a mechanism who's process is simultaneously the realisation of substantive democratic ideals.

But my hope is that a new account will allow democracy to pick itself up by its theoretical bootstraps and stand on firmer foundations, thus avoiding Churchill's most pessimistic justification of democracy as the least worst system of government.
