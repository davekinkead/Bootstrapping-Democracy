# A Democratic Dialectic

    Part I 
    - Liberalism & Democracy: same same but different
    - Liberalism & Democracy: seem to play nicely together

The terms `liberal` and `democracy` often go hand in hand.  When most people talk about democracy they are typically referring to liberal democracy [^who].  Some philosophers and political theorists [^who] even think that democratic values _are_ liberal values and vice versa .

It's easy to see why liberalism and democracy are so often conflated.  For most of the last 200 years, almost all democracies were in fact liberal democracies.  Conversely, and with very few exceptions, non-democracies were typically illiberal.  The correlation between liberalism and democracy is incredibly strong.  Plotting electoral freedoms & political rights against civil liberties as measured by the watch dog group Freedom House, and performing regression analysis shows an r value of 0.9578 for their 2014 dataset, a near perfect correlation.   

Democracy and Liberalism however, are not the same things.  They describe different conceptions relating to individual freedom and political power.  The word democracy is derived from Greek _demos_ and _kratos_, meaning simply _the rule or power of the common people_.  And while it is certainly true that there are many competing conceptions of democracy, a common and essential element of them all is that they describe _who_ wields power in a society, who reigns and who is sovereign.

Liberal by contrast, is derived from the Latin _liber_ or free person.  It was an antonym of _servus_ or slave. In the Roman or republican sense, a liberal was anyone who was free from the oppression of others, and not dependent on the leave of a master.  During the enlightenment, a liberal came to be associated with anyone free from prejudice and intolerance.  These two conceptions of freedom - from oppression and intolerance - characterise liberalism today.  For a society to be considered liberal then, it must respect the personal freedom of its individual members and promote tolerance for differing conceptions of the good.

Neither democracy nor liberalism are freestanding conceptions however.  By freestanding here, I mean that neither conceptions .... can stand alone? is theoretically stable? ..... [more clarity needed here]

The instability of _naked democracy_ or unchecked majoritarianism, as well that of liberalism, has a well documented history.  As political theorists from Aristotle to Acton have observed, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Democracy requires some form of constraint, either procedural or substantive, on it's power in order to survive and remain democratic. Absent constitutional limits or strong political norms, naked democracy tends to degenerate into dictatorship and tyranny.  

> Tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty.  
> -- Plato, The Republic, Book 9

In electoral democracies, representatives unrestrained by the rule of law have a strong individual incentive to repeal constitutional constraints and undermine limits to their power.  History is littered with the debris of once democratic states, whose popularly elected leaders transformed into tyrants once they were elected to power - Mussolini's Italy, Hilter's Germany, Mugabe's Zimbabwe, and Lukashenko's Belarus serving as just a few examples. 

Like democracy, liberal theory also lacks the ability to stand alone.  Liberalism, what ever its form, requires the protection of certain beliefs, expressions, and actions from the interference of the state and other citizens.  These protections typically take the form of political and legal rights for individuals and corresponding duties on the state.  Liberalism determines and partitions private rights from public politics, constraining the power of the state to pass laws governing what has been deemed private affairs.  

Protecting and promoting any right however, necessarily comes at the expense of others.  As WN Hohfeld observed, rights are the correlatives of duties [^hohfeld1913].  Any right I may have to _X_ means that others have a duty not to prevent me _X_-ing.  The correlative identity of rights and duties means that general rights to _X_ and not _X_ cannot simultaneously exist if the correlative duties are imposed on the same subjects (typically the state).  As an example, a constitutional constraint that protects a citizens right to carry semi-automatic firearms in public ==necessarily== prevents the existence of right for citizens not to be injured or killed in a mass-shootings; and rights to absolute free speech ==necessarily== conflict with rights not to be defamed and offended by others; 

[this is too strong]

The realisation of any liberal conception as a constraint on democracy, must therefore result in the prioritisation of certain protections over others.  We must order our individual rights and determine which are to take priority over others; and specify the balance between free speech and defamation, the bearing of arms and physical safety.  These orderings can be viewed as a set of liberal values - some sets will be more compatible with others.  Some may even represent the optimal set of individual rights compatible with all others.  

> Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.   
> -- Zechariah Chafee, Jr.

The very tolerance that liberalism promotes results in competing conceptions of the good and corresponding disagreement about which rights should be prioritised over others.  And this pluralism of conceptions is not some mere contingent matter but rather the causal result of liberalism itself.  Different kinds of normative assessments, complex and conflicting empiric evidence, and judgements of relevance that freedom of religion, thought, and speech promote, all contribute to and entail different reasonable yet irreconcilable comprehensive doctrines. This fact of reasonable pluralism is, Rawls claims, "the long run outcome of human reason under free institutions" [^p4], a "permanent feature of democratic public culture" [^p36] and not some "unfortunate condition of human life" [^p37].  

Liberalism requires that some rights be promoted over, and at the expense of, others.  It requires the demarcation of the public sphere from the private realm.  But it also engenders an indeterminism concerning exactly where the public and the private should demarcated.  Without a mechanism to reconcile this inevitable yet reasonable disagreement, liberal societies are destined to instability.
