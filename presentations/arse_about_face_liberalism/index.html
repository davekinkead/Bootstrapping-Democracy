<h2>Arse About Face</h2>

<h3>Adjective, Adverb</h3>

<p><em>(idiomatic, UK, Australia)</em></p>

<ol>
<li> In a manner that is opposite to or the reverse of the way it should be, backwards.</li>
<li> Arranged in a confused or haphazard way; muddled.</li>
</ol>

<p>I should probably start with a clarification of terms for anyone not yet blessed by their exposure to the linguistic beauty that is Australian slang.  <em>Arse-about-face</em> is an anglo-australian colloquialism that means to get things-out-of-order, muddled, or backwards.  </p>

<h3>That Rawls fella has got this whole political liberalism thing arse about face.</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>There&#39;s something about political liberalism that has been bothering me lately.  A kind of niggling doubt that no matter how much we may want liberal democratic regimes to remain stable in the face of diversity, current liberal theory just isn&#39;t up to the task.</p>

<p>So today, I want to explore the idea that liberalism get things backwards.  It&#39;s <em>skew if</em>, to borrow another Australian turn of phrase.</p>

<p>More specifically though, I&#39;m going to defend the thesis that that the project of political liberalism approaches the problem of stability within liberal democratic regimes the wrong way.  That hope of stable liberal democratic regimes over time given the inevitability of reasonable pluralism is a lost cause.</p>

<p>So rather than attempt to monkey patch political liberalism onto a pluralist polity with fixed boundaries, I&#39;m propose we should instead use the idea of an overlapping consensus to define the very boundaries of our political associations themselves.  By reconceptualising <em>who</em> is included within a polity as an endogenous variable of liberal analysis, we can solve the problem of stability over time without the troubles faced by contemporary public reason theory.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>In the first half of this paper, I&#39;m going to examine some problems that liberal theory looks like it is unable to address.  Specifically two problems relating to the brittleness of the theory and its ability to endorse contradiction.</p>

<p>In the second half, I&#39;m going to propose a way of reconceptualising political liberalism so that it doesn&#39;t succumb to these problems.  I&#39;ll try and articulate a concept of jurisdictional fluidity that I&#39;m working on, and try and deal with the inevitable objections.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Stability</h2>

<p>In <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, Rawls tried to answer the question of what is the most appropriate way of specifying fair terms of cooperation within a society. It was an attempt to reconcile the conflicting requirements of liberty and equality in a way that utilitarianism had been unable to do.</p>

<p>His answer was <em>Justice as Fairness</em>, and its derivative principles of <em>Equal Liberty</em> and <em>Difference</em>.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Yet as Rawls himself acknowledged, his account had a major flaw.  Much of <em>A Theory</em> was predicated on a largely Kantian conception of liberalism.  But realising a conception of political justice predicated upon a widely accepted comprehensive conception of the good is both highly unlikely and inherently unstable.</p>

<p>From a political-historical perspective, the spontaneous emergence of widespread comprehensive liberal values within a society appears to be highly unlikely.  Broad endorsement of a comprehensive liberal doctrine is a relatively recent phenomenon within the West, and can be seen as a gradual evolution of thought and value since the enlightenment, shaped by political institutions, culture and social norms.  It is not something that just happens overnight or arrives at the doorstep one morning.</p>

<p>Yet contemporary history demonstrates the fragility of comprehensive liberal doctrines even within constitutionally liberal regimes.  The rise of European fascism in the 1930s, 1960s, and today the emergence of parties like Golden Dawn in Greece, are just a few examples of how the evolution of comprehensive liberalism is not a monotonic, or unidirectional, process.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step'  id=stable-img>
    
<p>However liberalism itself is inherently unstable.  As a doctrine of liberty that respects, enables, and promotes a plurality of views politically, philosophically, and morally, liberalism sows the seeds of its own destruction.  </p>

<p>Liberal regimes lead to not just a diversity of competing liberal conceptions of the good, but also of opposing and irreconcilable beliefs, illiberal yet still perfectly reasonable; something Rawls saw as the &quot;inevitable long run result of the powers of human reason at work within the background of enduring free institutions&quot; [^rawls1996:4].</p>

<p>More problematically, it seems that many of the most important issues - theology, science, the good - are the most intractable, leading Rawls to worry that &quot;we should find it remarkable that, so deeply opposed in these ways, just cooperation among free and equal citizens is possible at all&quot; [^rawls1996:4]</p>

<p>This plurality within liberal democracies then, &quot;is not a mere historical condition that may soon pass ways; it is a permanent feature of the public culture of democracy.&quot; [^ralws1996:36]</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>So the idea of <em>Justice as Fairness</em> as outlined in the <em>Theory</em>, was predicated on a stable liberal democratic regime, itself based upon a comprehensive liberal doctrine.  The result of this however, would be reasonable pluralism, including reasonable illiberal doctrines.  </p>

<p>It was, Rawls notes, reliant on a</p>

<blockquote>
<p>premise the realisation of which it&#39;s principles of justice ruled out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[^ralws1996:xvi]</p>

<p>To try an sustain a liberal, or illiberal for that matter, regime based on a comprehensive moral doctrine could therefore &quot;be maintained only by the oppressive use of state power&quot; [^ralws1996:37], something Rawls christened the <em>Fact of Oppression</em></p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Public Reason</h2>

<p>To reconcile liberalism with stability over time, Rawls proposed an account of <em>Political Liberalism</em> which differed from comprehensive forms of liberalism in its scope and justification.</p>

<p>Much of the normative work of of this account is done by the notion of a <em>political conception of justice</em>, a freestanding moral doctrine directed at society&#39;s basic political institutions, informed by, yet prior to, individual comprehensive conceptions of justice.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>This political conception of justice is derived from the <em>Idea of an Overlapping Consensus</em> and the <em>Idea of Public Reason</em>.</p>

<h3>Public Reason as Criteria</h3>

<p>The <em>Idea of Public Reason</em> provides the criteria for including and evaluating political discourse.  </p>

<p>Public reasons are, rather tautologically, public.  They are not simply the public statement of private reasons but rather the public statement of reasons that 1) other reasonable citizens would understand, 2) we ourselves would accept, 3) we reasonably believe others would reasonably accept. [^rawls1997:771]</p>

<p>It is this expectation of reasonable acceptance, governed by the criteria of reciprocity and duty of civility, that imbues laws developed in this way with legitimacy.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>Overlapping Consensus</h3>

<p>The <em>Idea of An Overlapping Consensus</em>, is the mechanism for obtaining agreement and stability in the face reasonable diversity.  The overlapping consensus determines what principles of basic social order are included within the the political conception of justice and members are committed to them because they have reached a consensus for the right reasons.</p>

<p>The political conception of justice then, includes only those values which have an overlapping consensus, suitably constrained and informed by the criteria of public reason, directed solely at basic political institutions of society, and reconciled with members comprehensive reasonable doctrines.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Brittleness</h2>

<p>There is now a pretty substantial body of work on public reason and political liberalism.  Jonothan Quong [^quong2009:5] has identified something like seven different types of criticisms to <em>Political Liberalism</em> alone.  But rather than address these here, I want to forward two more problems that bother me particularly: brittleness and contradiction.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>Diversity, Breadth &amp; Strength</h3>

<p>The stability of a liberal democratic regime under Rawl&#39;s political liberalism is informed by three factors: the underlying diversity of comprehensive doctrines, the breadth of overlapping consensus towards the political conception of justice, and the strength of commitment to that conception.</p>

<p>Rawls was particularly worried by the third issue manifesting in what he calls a <em>modus vivendi</em>.  Here, a live and let live form of tolerance based on the wrong reasons, such as an inability to overpower and trump political rivals, may appear as consensus but is in fact, unstable.  As soon as conditions change, conflict emerges because parties are not committed to actual concept of tolerance.</p>

<p>But there is an inevitable conflict then between these drivers of stability, witnessed by the debate between consensus and convergence views of public reason.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>Strength =&gt; &lt;= Breadth</h3>

<p>There is an interplay here between the strength of commitment to ideals resulting from a consensus based the <em>right</em> reasons, and the breadth of commitment to those ideals resulting from a consensus based on <em>any</em> reason.</p>

<p>We can increase the breadth of overlapping consensus by loosening our requirement for consensus from the right reasons to any reasons.  This is the approach of convergence accounts like Jerry Gaus&#39; but the stability of any subsequent regime is undermined because they fail to adequately address the problem of <em>modus vivendi</em>.</p>

<p>We could on the other hand, promote stability by strengthening commitment for the right reasons, something Quong does by qualifying the &#39;reasonableness&#39; requirement but we can only do so at the cost of breadth of support.  </p>

<p>Because just as no one rightly believes that a belief they hold to be true is false, few if anyone would hold their own belief, which they hold to be true, to be unreasonable.  Strengthening commitment for the right reasons then, narrows the scope for an overlapping consensus because it annexes or disenfranchises the values of many within the regime from consideration.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Liberalism of this form then, can be considered brittle.  Its stability is derived from an interplay of forces that are largely in opposition and any attempt to promote stability from one direction, undermines stability from the other.  </p>

<p>This brittleness is exacerbated by the degree of diversity within a political unit, something which the realisation of political liberalism entails. </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Contradiction</h2>

<p>There is another, perhaps more fatal problem for political liberalism. Political Liberalism seems to endorse contradictions.</p>

<p>Consider a hypothetical polity whose members form three broad group: christians, muslims, and anti-theists.  Each group hold strong, intractable theo/anti-theological views but are otherwise reasonable according to Rawls&#39; definition.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>We might consider two potential positions regarding justice and the good:</p>

<ul>
<li>P - that the state should endorse Christianity as the official religion.</li>
<li>Q - that the state should endorse Islam as the official religion.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Despite liberal democracies like Denmark and Norway already endorsing an official state religion, liberal theory would hold we endorse neither. That despite proposing terms that we reasonably believe others could reasonably accept (our views being reasonable and true after all), no overlapping consensus could be found and thus we must endorse:</p>

<ul>
<li>R - that neither P nor Q can be included in our political conception of justice.</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>But what about bivalent propositions?</p>

<ul>
<li>S - that the state should support any religious group</li>
<li>T - that the state should not support any religious group</li>
</ul>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>~ (S v T)</h3>

<h3>S &lt;=&gt; ~T</h3>

<h3>~S &amp; S</h3>

<p>Because of the presence of both committed theists and anti-theists, it seems that neither propositions could be included in the set that make up the political conception of justice.  And because they are bivalent, S is equivalent to ~T, rejecting both seems contradictory.</p>

<p>At best, political liberalism seems to endorse possible positions arbitrarily based on their order of presentation. At worst it seems to endorse contradiction. </p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Boundaries</h2>

<p>The boundaries of political units within liberal theory have typically been taken to be exogenous to analysis.  Liberal theory focuses inward, to the rights, duties, and distribution of primary goods within a society.</p>

<p>In liberal theories with pre-political geneses such as Locke&#39;s, people &quot;incorporate and make one body politic&quot; by agreeing to the &quot;bonds of civil society&quot; ...  &quot;This any number ... may do because it injures not the freedom of the rest&quot; [^locke1690:8-96]</p>

<p>And liberal theories with societal geneses have a similar inward focus.  In <em>Theory</em>, Rawls begins with the idea of a society before examining how it ought be organised. In <em>Political Liberalism</em>, he makes this explicit: </p>

<p>&quot;the basic structure is that of a closed society: that is, we are to regard it as self-contained and as having no relations with other societies.&quot; [^rawls1996:12]</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The inward focus of political liberalism is driven not by theoretical necessity, but rather by simplicity.  It&#39;s an &quot;abstraction, justified only because it enables us to focus on certain main questions free from distracting details.&quot; [^rawls1996:12] </p>

<p>Of course, this is not to say that liberalism ignores outward relations between peoples. Rawls for example, devotes an entire book to relations between states.  It&#39;s just that he is explicit that these outward relations are not governed by the same principles as inward ones when he denies that the difference and equal liberty principles apply between states.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>Of course it&#39;s easy to provide some descriptive account of why political boundaries have always been assumed to be fixed in liberal theory. Since the Treaty of Westphalia, the nation state has been the primary entity of political relations.</p>

<p>But just because that&#39;s the way it&#39;s always been done doesn&#39;t strike me as a particularly good normative reason for continuing to do so.  We can, as I hope to show, gain considerably from reconceptualising liberalism so that the boundaries of political association are endogenous or dependent variables to our analysis.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>A key driver of the problems brittleness and potential contradiction, is that the fixed boundaries and inward focus of liberal theory fail to provide sufficient flexibility for liberal induced pluralism.</p>

<p>The problem of brittleness arises because the drivers of stability are in opposition and the diversity that liberalism produces pushes them further into opposition.</p>

<p>The problem of potential contradiction arises because the mechanism for including particular values into the conception of political justice allows the rejection of bivalent propositions.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>So what would this look like?  Lets return to our example of a liberal state divided by theological views.</p>

<p>[DIAGRAM]</p>

<p>In matters where an overlapping consensus of reasonable views exists, then conceptions of political justice and subsequent institutions to realise them would be shared.</p>

<p>But in matters where no overlapping consensus across the whole state exists, consensus can still be found in regions within the state.  On these matters, conceptions of justice and subsequent institutions are shared only locally. There might be state endorsement of an official religion in these sub regions, agreement on state support for religious organisations across theist regions, and no integration of church and state in anti-theist regions.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<p>The result is a multilayered lattice of shared and institutions, the boundaries of which are determined by an overlapping consensus on conceptions of justice.  Because boundaries are not static, the problems of brittleness and potential contradiction that current liberal theory faces are solved.  Because comprehensive doctrines that some may not accept no longer have the potential to be forced upon others, stability of the state as a whole is strengthened.</p>

<p>The fluidity of boundaries acts like a pressure release valve for the opposing forces of strength and breadth of commitment.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h2>Objections</h2>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>How</h3>

<p>The most obvious objection to the reconceptualisation of liberal theory is <em>how</em>?  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t given an account of what kind of political mechanism could ever realise a fluidity of boundaries like I&#39;ve just described.  This is partly because I haven&#39;t fully developed such an account but I can envisage two potential options.</p>

<p>One possible idea would be some form of dynamic redrawing of boundaries for each component issue of the political conception of justice.  My preferred idea however is some form of loose confederation of smaller static jurisdictions such as local councils, who then share institutional arrangements based on their residents conception of justice.</p>

<p>This would of course be predicated upon some broader, first order agreement to share institutions, but I don&#39;t think this is too difficult to imaging given existing multilayered federated jurisdictions such as Switzerland, Australia, or the EU.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>That&#39;s Not Stability!</h3>

<p>It might also be claimed that I&#39;m not offering stability at all.  How can this be considered stable if boundaries can ebb and flow?</p>

<p>My response would be that this objection conflates stability with rigidity.  The higher level state isn&#39;t changing at all, simply its internal confederations.  The fluidity actually strengthens the state as a whole because it removes the likelihood for internal conflict by limiting the scope for the imposition of unwanted values by internal blocks.</p>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
    
<h3>WTF?</h3>
</div>
      <div class='step' >
