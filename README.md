## Abstract

This is an argument about method.  I am proposing a new computational philosophical methodology - _argumentum in silico_.  Modelling has been a part of philosophy since the beginning; simulation since computers were available.

But rather than trying to use simulations to support or suppliment arguments, I use simulations _as_ argument.
