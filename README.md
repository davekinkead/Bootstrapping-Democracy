# Democracy's Paradox

This is an argument about authority; more specifically though, it's an argument about democratic authority and how what we typically think are justifications of democratic authority are in actual fact rationalisations of political authority. That's because accounts of democratic authority, all of them, fail to adequately justify the authority of the state.  What is left are mere rationalisation; attempts to make the coercive power of the state more palatable to those it coerces.

Despite the bewildering array of approaches that political theorists have used in attempting to explain why we as citizens have moral obligations to obey the edicts of properly elected democratic regimes, whenever we trace their arguments back far enough, we are confronted with web of contradiction and paradox.  Proceduralist accounts for example, imbue a democratic authority with legitimacy just in case the laws and policies it produces are the result of a legitimate procedure, one that is fair and just.  Yet proceduralist accounts of democratic authority are strangely silent on how exactly these procedures can be legitimately established in the first place.  How do we legitimately establish first order procedures such as the constitution without higher order ones, and do these higher order procedures need to be legitimate for subsequent procedures to be?

Or consider perhaps instrumentalist accounts of democratic authority which justify the authority of the state by appealing to the outcomes of a democratic process.  Democracy here is justified by its difference making ability.  But the ability of a democratic process to produce outcomes different to non-democratic ones, sufficient enough to justify democracy's authority, is undermined by what has come to be know as the Boundary Problem.  Democracy presupposes a demos, but is unable to explain exactly who the people ought be.  Yet who the people are largely predetermines the outcome of any democratic process, rendering the impact of the process largely arbitrary, and thus undermining those claims of legitimacy based on difference making.

Nor do substantive justifications of democracy fair any better. Liberal accounts of democracy for example, justify the authority of the state from the equal liberty and freedom for all it enables.  This liberty is typically realised by formally protecting certain rights of individuals against claims of the state and others.  But these 

These challenge collectively form what I call the _Bootstrap Paradox_ - the inability of democracy to justify itself democratically.  Democracy, both as a political theory and implementation of government, cannot adequately explain who should be included within its association, how its processes should be designed and organised, or what limits should be placed on its authority.  As a political theory, democracy is hobbled by contradictions. As a system of government, its authority lacks sufficient normative justification.

In the first half of my thesis, I examine these problems in detail and demonstrate how they undermine extant accounts of democratic legitimacy, relegating much democratic theory to the rationalisation rather than justification of political authority.  In the second half, I develop an account of democratic legitimacy that bootstraps itself - justifies its self on its own terms.  From a single normative principle, I demonstrate how the essence of democracy - self government - can be realised without succumbing to these problems.
