This repo is a collection of notes for my PhD in Political Philosophy at the University of Queensland.

Core Thesis
===========

"That a legitimate material interest ought to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for suffrage"

Argument Outline
================


Justifying Democracy
--------------------

A literature review of existing justifications for democracy.  Christiano characterises these as instrumental: epistemic value, strategic value, moral character; and non-instrumental: liberty, equality, public justification.
What are the assumptions that underpin democratic justifications? What are the key arguments for each?

Justifying Suffrage
-------------------

An examination of specific motivations for universal suffrage (extending from the previous chapter) and the arguments against disenfranchisement.  Universal suffrage seems to be taken as ‘self evident’ in modern literature but why?
Dworkin puts forward an (incorrect) argument that universal suffrage is necessary for the state to provide equal consideration and therefore human dignity.

- Mill, JS. 1861 Utilitarianism
- Montesquieu, 1731 The Spirit of the Laws
Condorcet

Justifying Jurisdiction
-----------------------

What are the normative justifications of jurisdictional boundaries.  Is there anything more than political realism & historical accident to justify present jurisdictions once issues such as gerrymandering have been addressed?

Readings:
- Madison, J. Federalist #10

Constraining Suffrage
---------------------

Look at other concepts of suffrage & eligibility and their use to demonstrate the universal suffrage is not ‘universal’: equal vs census suffrage, youth & demeny voting, exclusion by race, class, religion, qualification, property, function or action (criminality). Jurisdictional issues and how they relate to the justifications of suffrage chapter - residency, nationality

Legitimate Material Interest
----------------------------

If the purpose of suffrage is to ensure equal consideration is given to all parties, then universal suffrage fails to achieve this.

Present the core argument of my thesis - that a suffrage ought to be constrained to only those holding a legitimate material interest.   Adapt Mill’s argument - if it can be shown that a purported right or duty is harmful, then is has been shown that it is not genuine - to show universal suffrage leads to tyranny (Burheim’s negative argument).
