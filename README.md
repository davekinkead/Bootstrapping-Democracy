# Bootstrapping Democracy

This is an argument about authority; more specifically though, it's an argument about democratic authority and how what we typically think are justifications of democratic authority are in actual fact rationalisations of political authority. That's because accounts of democratic authority, all of them, fail to adequately justify the authority of the state.  What is left are rationalisation; attempts to make the coercive power of the state more palatable to those it coerces.

Despite the bewildering array of approaches that political theorists have used in attempting to explain why we as citizens have moral obligations to obey the edicts of properly elected democratic regimes, whenever we trace their arguments back far enough, we are confronted with web of contradiction and paradox.  Proceduralist accounts for example, imbue a democratic authority with legitimacy just in case the laws and policies it produces are the result of a legitimate procedure, one that is fair and just.  Yet proceduralist accounts of democratic authority are strangely silent on how exactly these procedures can be legitimately established in the first place.  How do we legitimately establish first order procedures such as the constitution without higher order ones, and do these higher order procedures need to be legitimate for subsequent procedures to be?

Or consider perhaps instrumentalist accounts of democratic authority which justify the authority of the state by appealing to the outcomes of a democratic process.  Democracy here is justified by its difference making ability.  But the ability of a democratic process to produce outcomes different to non-democratic ones, sufficient enough to justify democracy's authority, is undermined by what has come to be know as the Boundary Problem.  Democracy presupposes a demos, but is unable to explain exactly who the people ought be.  Yet who the people are largely predetermines the outcome of any democratic process, rendering the impact of the process largely arbitrary, and thus undermining those claims of legitimacy based on difference making.

Nor do substantive justifications of democracy fair any better. Liberal accounts of democracy for example, justify the authority of the state from the equal liberty and freedom for all it enables.  This liberty is typically realised by formally protecting certain rights of individuals against claims of the state and others.  But these 

These challenge collectively form what I call the _Bootstrap Paradox_ - the inability of democracy to justify itself democratically.  Democracy, both as a political theory and implementation of government, cannot adequately explain who should be included within its association, how its processes should be designed and organised, or what limits should be placed on its authority.  As a political theory, democracy hobbled by contradictions. As a system of government, its authority lacks sufficient normative justification.

In the first half of my thesis, I examine these problems in detail and demonstrate how they undermine extant accounts of democratic legitimacy, relegating much democratic theory to the rationalisation rather than justification of political authority.  In the second half, I develop an account of democratic legitimacy that bootstraps itself - justifies its self on its own terms.  From a single normative principle, I demonstrate how the essence of democracy - self government - can be realised without succumbing to these problems.

    
## The Problem of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  The _demos_ is the _kratos_, _praxis_, and _telos_ of the state.  

Democratic theory presupposes the existence of a determinate polity of people who organise together and govern themselves.  Yet the matter of _who_ ought be included amongst the people is a matter both logically and temporally prior to that of _how_ they ought govern.  The question of who must consent, who ought be heard, or who should be entitled to vote, cannot be answered democratically without first knowing who to ask.  Democracy - the rule of, for, and by the people - simply cannot answer the fundamental issue of which people should be governed under which state.  Who ought make up the people can therefore only be answered by some pre- or non-democratic principle.

Reliance upon some extra-democratic principle to justify democratic inclusions should not however, be problematic in and of itself. Numerous normative principles rely on earlier, lower order ones to provide some form of moral foundation.  And a number of principles - nationalism; linguistic, cultural, and economic salience; geographical proximity; the status quo; and the all-affected principle - have been proposed as possible solutions.  Yet these proposals all fail when the claims of democratic legitimacy rely upon difference making.

Difference making lays at the heart of many accounts of democratic legitimacy.  According to these theories, a democratic state is legitimate precisely because it brings about different outcomes or states of affairs relative to non-democratic ones.  Inspired by Condorcet, epistemic accounts praise democracies _truth tracking_ abilities; strategic accounts claim democracies make better policy because the interests of all are considered; and personal autonomy accounts accept democracy as the best way to ensure fidelity between individual and collective interests.

But who makes up the people largely predetermines the outcome of a democratic process, irrespective of the particular democratic mechanism used.  The question of inclusion strips democratic processes of their difference making power and renders them either causally powerless.  The power of difference making is thus usurped by the principle of inclusion, a principle completely exogenous to extant democratic accounts.  The decisions and outcomes of democracies become attributable to the accidents of history, and thus erode any subsequent normative claims based on difference.


## Paradoxes of Procedure

In this chapter, I explore foundational paradoxes of procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy.  According to procedural accounts of democracy, legitimacy is derived from adherence or fidelity to some process or constitution.  But how can the creation of this constitution be legitimate when its creation proceeds its existence? How can a decision mechanism be agreed upon democratically?  The democratic method would be to deliberate or vote on the method but this requires some earlier agreement on what decision method will be used to answer this question.  

I also examine challenges raised by social choice theory such as Arrow's Impossibility Theory Condorcet's Paradox of Transitivity whereby seemingly 'irrational' intransitive collective or aggregated preferences arise from 'rational' transitive ones.  Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot overcome these foundational paradoxes without evolving into substantive or utopian accounts, which undermines their ability to imbue legitimacy.


## Limits of Liberalism

In this chapter, I explore the impossibility of contesting liberalism democratically.  According to liberal theory, legitimacy requires the protection of certain individual rights and freedoms.  But how can disagreement over the limits between public and private be decided on without undermining liberalism? Determining this limit collectively makes the question of what is a private right a public issue.  But determining the limit by some other means, say judicially, requires some earlier agreement on how the limit will be decided, and simply pushes the problem back one level.

Rawls, Gaus and other liberal theorists have proposed variants of liberal theory such as public reason.  These mechanisms however, appear endorse contractions in what values or policies liberal democracies should hold, or arbitrarily endorse values depending on the order they are debated. 


## Bootstrapping Democracy

In this chapter, I explore whether democracy can solve these problems by picking itself up from its own theoretical bootstraps. Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot recover from founding paradoxes without turning into utopian or substantive accounts.  Substantive accounts seem unable to simultaneously underpin democratic legitimacy and solve the boundary problem. But what if we could develop an account where adherence to the process is also the realisation of the substantive ideal? We would then have a potential way to bootstrap our way out of these dilemmas.  We would be able to bootstrap democracy.

My starting point is the identification of what exactly democratic theory needs to justify in order to claim legitimacy.  Here, I argue that unlike accounts based on affect or coercion, democratic theory only needs to justify its political authority - the moral obligation to be obeyed _simply_ because it is commanded.


## Reciprocal Autonomy

In this chapter, I develop the normative foundations of my solution to the Bootstrap Paradox.  I identify autonomy as a self-realising foundation that can exist simply by its assertion.  I argue that recognising the autonomy of others and therefore their claim to self rule, on the proviso that they recognise ours, is the minimum requirement for political cooperation and once accepted, both underpins our own claims of self determination whilst limiting our claims over others. 


## Dynamic Federalism

In this chapter, I develop a framework for realising the basic unit of political association.  The Principle of Reciprocal Autonomy provides a necessary, but not sufficient condition for solving the Bootstrap Paradox.  I show how a dynamic system of overlapping jurisdictions allows us to realise political association without succumbing to the earlier paradoxes I explore.
