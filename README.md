Limiting Suffrage
=================

This is a work-in-progress and reading management experiment for my PhD in Political Philosophy at the University of Queensland.  It covers my thesis outline, readings, ideas and draft arguments.

The thesis that I will defend is that a legitimate material interest ought to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for suffrage.  My dissertation will be comprised of two parts:

- Extending John Burheim's observation that only those affected by some issue ought to have any say in the matter and defending it as a normative political principle.
- Examining the consequences of this principle and how it affects democratic governance.
