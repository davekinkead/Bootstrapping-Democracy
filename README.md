So here's the thing.  I've just past my final thesis review and all I need to do now is submit.  The only problem is that I've lost all motivation.  Bugger.

On the bright side though, I've got a paper that's been getting rave feedback by colleagues is currently under review at the Journal of Political Philosophy having made it past a desk rejection.

So I now want to write the world's first computer executable philosophy thesis.  I've got three computational papers in various stages of drafts and have a bunch of ideas for more.  That means I can submit a thesis by partial publication which only requires chapters to be under review, along with additional commentary about the project.

Here's what I think my thesis could look like.

  1. Introduction.  Commentary on my project and each paper.
  2. Methodology. A lit review and justification of computational approaches to political philosophy.
  3. A New Challenge to the Jury Theorem.  I show whenever choices about inclusion need to be made, CDT assumptions don't necessarily hold internally even when they are true externally.
  4. Borders and Legitimacy. I show that different types of instrumental justifications of democracy are incompatible.
  5. Egalitarianism isn't Equal.  I show that under normal conditions, egalitarian justifications of democracy can't deliver political equality.
  6. States of Nature.  I demonstrate the (in)compatibility of assumptions about the nature of man made by Hobbes, Locke, & Rousseau.
  7. Is politics necessity.  I demonstrate the conditions when democratic necessity arguments are entailed.
  8. Conclusion.

And that's that. I may have to change the authority stuff to democracy but why not?
