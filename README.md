Limiting Suffrage
=================

This is a work-in-progress and reading management experiment for my PhD in Political Philosophy at the University of Queensland.  It covers my thesis outline, readings, ideas and draft arguments.

The thesis that I will defend is that a legitimate material interest ought to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for suffrage.  My dissertation will be comprised of two parts:

- Extending John Burheim's observation that only those affected by some issue ought to have any say in the matter and defending it as a normative political principle.
- Examining the consequences of this principle and how it affects democratic governance.

Below are the broad themes that I wish to address and which will hopefully form my chapters.

-----



Part 1
======

The purpose of part one is to establish new normative democratic principle - that suffrage ought only be extended to those affected by some issue.


Suffrage & Democracy
--------------------

Literature review and examination of the role suffrage plays in Democracy.
What is democracy? How is it justified? What is the role between suffrage & democracy?

Instrumental justifications:

- epistemic value,
- strategic value,
- enhanced moral character;

Non-instrumental justifications:

- liberty,
- equality,
- public justification.


Is voting even necessary in Democracy?  Does voting have any intrinsic democratic value? Only political equality and popular sovereignty seem to be constitutive elements of democracy.  Voting is neither necessary (see sortition) nor sufficient (see Soviet voting methods) for sound democracies.

Look at other concepts of suffrage & eligibility and their use to demonstrate the universal suffrage is never ‘universal’: 

- equal vs census suffrage, 
- youth & demeny voting, 
- exclusion by race, class, religion, qualification, property, function or action (criminality). 
Jurisdictional issues and how they relate to the justifications of suffrage chapter - residency, nationality




Legitimate Material Interest
----------------------------

Introduce Burnheim's thesis and expand it.

The key folk conception of this is that only those affected by something should have any say in the matter.  Why ought the Taliban have no say in the education curriculum of Queensland schools?  Why ought I have no in the WA curricular or even that on the Gold Coast?

I need to address the definition and scope of LMI.  I then need to outline how I will defend my LMI thesis.

What is an material interest?

- Mill's Harm Principle?
- Any claim?
- How is this to be assessed?

What is legitimate?

- obtained via moral means?

LMI are rights claims.  To assert I have a LMI is to assert I have a right to be considered in the decision process relating to the LMI.

- what happens if property rights are just conventions (i.e. the retributive theory of rights)?



The Argument from Autonomy
--------------------------

P1 - Autonomy is good.  I think it is unproblematic to merely assert this when arguing within the liberal conception of politics. 

- What is the nature of autonomy? How does it relate to liberty, freedom, and means? Positive, negative, or republican?
- Does autonomy come in degrees or is it binary? 
- Why is it good?  
- How does personal autonomy relate to political autonomy?


P2 - Limiting autonomy is bad. From (1) it is bad because it limits a good.  There may be grounds for limiting autonomy but it seem wrong ceteris paribus.

- What are the limits to this? 
- Are there any exceptions?
- Does denying suffrage over issues that don't affect an agent limit their autonomy? (Key to my argument - No!)


P3 - Following from (1) and (2), we are committed to a minimalist scope polis wherever possible because this simultaneously maximises (1) and minimises (2). (scope of the state)

- Are there alternatives that satisfy (1) and (2)?
- Are we committed to an anarchist or liberal conception of state?


P4 - Some issues however must be political as they affect more than one agent and therefore require some form of political equality / democracy in the decision making processes.  (decision making process)

- if autonomy is necessary for democracy, then democracy requires a liberal scope.


C6 - From (2), if someone is affected by an decision, they must be granted suffrage (the sufficient condition)

P7 - Granting suffrage to those who aren't affected by a decision doesn't increases the non-affected agent's autonomy (1) but does decrease the affected agent's autonomy which is wrong (2).  

C8 - Therefore suffrage ought be limited to only those affected (the necessity condition)

Objections???

- do I mean autonomy, personal sovereignty, liberty or freedom here?


The Epistemic Argument
----------------------

Epistemic arguments for LMI start from a variety of positions.

**Condorcet Jury Theory**


- if any voter has p(correct) > 0.5, then as voters n->inf, p(correct) -> 1.0 
- influenced by changes in p(correct), n, 

Public choice theory


The Argument from Equality
--------------------------

Does this differ from the argument from autonomy?



------


Part 2
======


The purpose of part two is to examine the implications of part one.  One immediate effect is that jurisdiction becomes an endogenous issue for political philosophy.  Lots of work to do here….. 



Suffrage & Jurisdiction
-----------------------

What are the normative justifications of jurisdictional boundaries.  Is there anything more than political realism & historical accident to justify present jurisdictions once issues such as gerrymandering have been addressed?  What are the relevant issues of jurisprudence?

Why is an issue a political one in the first place?  What are the normative grounds for res publica?

- historical accident? Why should the status quo be elevated?
- boundary of effect
- optimal cooperation
- collective choice
