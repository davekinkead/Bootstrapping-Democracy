This is a collection of notes for my PhD in Political Philosophy at the University of Queensland.  My thesis is still under development but the core argument will be:

> "That a legitimate material interest ought to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for suffrage"


Argument Outline
================


Justifying Democracy
--------------------

A literature review of existing justifications for democracy.  Christiano characterises these as instrumental:

- epistemic value,
- strategic value,
- enhanced moral character;

and non-instrumental:

- liberty,
- equality,
- public justification.

What are the assumptions that underpin democratic justifications? What are the key arguments for each?

Justifying Suffrage
-------------------

Universal suffrage seems to be taken as ‘self evident’ in modern literature but why?  Generally, universal suffrage is advocated on the grounds that it enables and/or enhances democracy:

- greater suffrage enhances epistemic value (see Condorcet).
- more suffrage equates to more deliberation and moral improvement of the demos.
- it creates a formal structure for the equal concern of all (see [Dworkin](literature review/Is Democracy Possible Here?) (incorrectly)
- formalises political equality under the law
- ensuring that more people participate leads to democratic flourishing (see deliberative accounts & Mill)
- universal suffrage is argued as necessary to avoid tyranny (who?)
- provides a means for consent (see Consent Theory)
- provides a method of public justification as large voter turnouts are used to legitimise results and claim mandates

Do differing conceptions of democracy, ie liberal vs republican, affect justifications for suffrage?

Justifying Jurisdiction
-----------------------

What are the normative justifications of jurisdictional boundaries.  Is there anything more than political realism & historical accident to justify present jurisdictions once issues such as gerrymandering have been addressed?  What are the relevant issues of jurisprudence?

Readings:

- Madison, J. Federalist #10


Constraining Suffrage
---------------------

Is voting even necessary in Democracy?  Does voting have any intrinsic democratic value? Only political equality and popular sovereignty seem to be constitutive elements of democracy.  Voting is neither necessary (see sortition) nor sufficient (see Soviet voting methods) for sound democracies.

Look at other concepts of suffrage & eligibility and their use to demonstrate the universal suffrage is never ‘universal’: equal vs census suffrage, youth & demeny voting, exclusion by race, class, religion, qualification, property, function or action (criminality). Jurisdictional issues and how they relate to the justifications of suffrage chapter - residency, nationality

Legitimate Material Interest
----------------------------

If the purpose of suffrage is to ensure equal consideration is given to all parties and limit tyranny, then universal suffrage fails to properly achieve this.

If suffrage is supposed to restrain tyranny by given everyone an equal voice, then universal suffrage fails.  Tyranny of the majority is MORE LIKELY to occur when those not affected on an issue are given a say.

Majority voting is a mechanism intended to produce political equality.  Argued here is that political equality requires equal weighted voting but the equivalency of equal weighting with political equality assumes an equal interest in or concern with any given issue.

Mill's argument: if it can be shown that a purported right or duty is harmful, then is has been shown that it is not genuine.  Universal suffrage produces tyranny by giving those without claim a say and is therefore not genuine.
