Limiting Suffrage
=================

This is a work-in-progress and reading management experiment for my PhD in Political Philosophy at the University of Queensland.  It covers my thesis outline, readings, ideas and draft arguments.

The thesis that I will defend is that a legitimate material interest ought to be both a necessary and sufficient condition for suffrage.  My dissertation will be comprised of two parts:

- Extending John Burheim's observation that only those affected by some issue ought to have any say in the matter and defending it as a normative political principle.
- Examining the consequences of this principle and how it affects democratic governance.


Suffrage & Democracy
--------------------

Literature review and examination of the role suffrage plays in Democracy.
What is democracy? How is it justified? What is the role between suffrage & democracy?

Instrumental justifications:

- epistemic value,
- strategic value,
- enhanced moral character;

Non-instrumental justifications:

- liberty,
- equality,
- public justification.



Limiting Suffrage
-----------------

Is voting even necessary in Democracy?  Does voting have any intrinsic democratic value? Only political equality and popular sovereignty seem to be constitutive elements of democracy.  Voting is neither necessary (see sortition) nor sufficient (see Soviet voting methods) for sound democracies.

Look at other concepts of suffrage & eligibility and their use to demonstrate the universal suffrage is never ‘universal’: equal vs census suffrage, youth & demeny voting, exclusion by race, class, religion, qualification, property, function or action (criminality). Jurisdictional issues and how they relate to the justifications of suffrage chapter - residency, nationality




Legitimate Material Interest
----------------------------

Introduce Burnheim's thesis and expand it.

The key folk conception of this is that only those affected by something should have any say in the matter.  Why ought the Taliban have no say in the education curriculum of Queensland schools?  Why ought I have no in the WA curricular or even that on the Gold Coast?

What is the normative basis for this?  There are two distinct arguments for LMI: Boundary of Effect & Proportional Interest but both reduce to issues of personal sovereignty and tyranny.  In reverse....

I define personal sovereignty as the degree of influence an agent has over a particular outcome, relative to other agents.  I say influence rather than control because most causes don't necessitate their effects; and relative to others as a means to define the Possible.  Physical reality is taken to be the boundary of the Possible and the observed abilities of others serves as a rough proxy for this.

On collective matters, personal sovereignty can be described as a function of relative influence:

 S = i / ∑ i(n) where 0 ≤ S ≤ 1

 Tyranny can be thought of as the inequality of sovereignty amongst those who can influence an outcome:

 T = ∑ S(max) - S  /  n  where 0 ≤ T ≤ 1

 (see Why Fishkin is wrong about Tyranny)

 Tyranny therefore occurs whenever
 1) an agents sovereignty is less than 1, and
 2) there is an unequal distribution of sovereignty amongst participants, and
 3) the participants have a legitimate material interest
 4) I find a non-circular argument. Bugger


Suffrage & Legitimacy
---------------------

Tyranny, sovereignty & authority


Suffrage & Knowledge
--------------------

Epistemic arguments for suffrage.  What effect does LMI have on this?


Suffrage & Equality
-------------------


Outline conceptions of equality.  Why should the state give equal concern to all (Dworkin)?  What do we mean by equal concern?
- treating everyone the same (outcome)
- treating everyone the same (needs)
- moral luck and just desert as grounds for prioritism.




Suffrage & Jurisdiction
-----------------------

What are the normative justifications of jurisdictional boundaries.  Is there anything more than political realism & historical accident to justify present jurisdictions once issues such as gerrymandering have been addressed?  What are the relevant issues of jurisprudence?

Why is an issue a political one in the first place?  What are the normative grounds for res publica?
- historical accident? Why should the status quo be elevated?
- boundary of effect
- optimal cooperation
- collective choice
