    Did the presentation follow a clear and logical sequence?
    Was the thesis topic, key results and research significance and outcomes communicated in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience?
    Did the speaker avoid scientific jargon, explain terminology and provide adequate background information to illustrate points?
    Did the presenter spend adequate time on each element of their presentation - or did they elaborate for too long on one aspect or was the presentation rushed?

Engagement & Communication

    Did the oration make the audience want to know more?
    Was the presenter careful not to trivialise or generalise their research?
    Did the presenter convey enthusiasm for their research?
    Did the presenter capture and maintain their audience's attention?
    Did the speaker have sufficient stage presence, eye contact and vocal range; maintain a steady pace, and have a confident stance?
    Did the PowerPoint slide enhance the presentation - was it clear, legible, and concise?


Why _should_ we obey the state?

What could give us reasons to obey?

And what could justify the state using coercive force against the people?

These are all questions about political authority. About when it is legitimate, and when it isn't.

And the answer that many people give to these questions, is democracy.  

In a democracy, we get to have a say in electing our officials, in shaping the law. We make the rules ourselves and that's why we should obey.  

It's a theory that's over 2500 years old but there's just one little problem with it.

It's wrong.

My thesis, _Democracy's Paradox_, explores the way that political theorists have tried to use democracy to justify the political authority of the state.  In it, I explore three paradoxes they lie at the very foundations of democratic theory. Paradoxes that seep up and undermine subsequent accounts of democratic legitimacy.

Take what I call the constitutional paradox.  

Democracy needs limits.  A line in the sand that says what is a public matter and what is a private matter.  Without these limits, democracy can quickly descend into mob rule and tyranny.

But how do we decide what these limits are?  One way that it can't be done is democratically.  That's because democratic actions are collective choices. And using a collective choice to decide what can't be decided upon collectively, reeks of contradiction.

But any non-democratic choice of limits is going to be hotly contested.  Should a right to free speech trump the right not to be slandered.  Or should the right to bear arms trump the right to public safety?

It turns out that our constitutional limits are often arbitrary - the accidents of history, from political contests long ago. And because of this, they undermine any claim that we have moral reasons to obey the state.

This and other paradoxes I explore show why democratic authority can't be justified - it can only be rationalised.  The best democratic theory can do is offer a hodge-podge of reasons about why we should obey - sometimes persuasively, but never coherently.

Now none of this means that democracy lacks value.  There are lots of good things about democracy and reasons we might desire it.  But if we want reasons why we should obey the state, then democracy cant give us those reasons.
