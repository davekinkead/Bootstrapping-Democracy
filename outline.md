## Defining Democracy

_Democracy_ is an essentially contested term.  In the political discourse of daily life, it is common to witness contradictory claims being justified as _democratic_.  Even within democratic theory, many scholars conflate democracy with the related but distinct notions of liberty, equality, voting, deliberation, and political participation.  But these conflations undermine accounts and criticisms of democratic legitimacy by failing to engage with the issues at hand and results in us talking past, rather than to, each other.

Politics however is about power. And democracy, like any -ocracy, is simply a description of who wields that power.  From it's etymological foundation, the rule of the many, I clarify the essential nature of democracy and strip it of normative content, arguing that any political system where power is wielded by those whom it is wielded over is justified invoking it's name.  From there, I develop a rich taxonomy of democratic predicates that rejects the simplistic dualisms and false dichotomies found in much of contemporary democratic literature.  I show how democracy can be illiberal and totalitarian, participatory but not deliberative, or even characterised by a complete absence of voting.  Finally, I show that while many predicated forms of democracy might be desirable, democracy itself is not a virtue.

## Democracy & Justification

Democracy is the preeminent form of political association of our times, and given the meteoric rise in the transition to democratic rule over the last 50 years, one might expect that the reasons for this would be clear enough; that the justifications of democratic rule would warrant wide consensus; or that debate concerning the nature of democratic legitimacy might be largely settled.  Yet even a cursory survey of political thought reveals that justifications of democracy are anything but widely accepted.  The vast literature of democratic theory proposes a wide and divergent range of accounts attempting to explain the authority of democratic regimes and our obligations as citizens to them.  

The failure of democratic theory to provide an agreed upon, or even coherent account of democratic authority and its legitimacy points to challenge that few theorists are prepared to acknowledge - that no broad agreement on an account justifying democratic authority exists because no account adequately justifying democratic authority can in fact exist.  Contemporary democratic theory rationalises, rather than justifies democratic authority


## The Problem of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  The _demos_ is the _kratos_, _praxis_, and _telos_ of the state.

Democratic theory presupposes the existence of a determinate polity of people who organise together and govern themselves.  Yet the matter of _who_ ought be included amongst the people is a matter both logically and temporally prior to that of _how_ they ought govern.  The question of who must consent, who ought be heard, or who should be entitled to vote, cannot be answered democratically without first knowing who to ask.  Democracy - the rule of, for, and by the people - simply cannot answer the fundamental issue of which people should be governed under which state.  Who ought make up the people can therefore only be answered by some pre- or non-democratic principle.

Reliance upon some extra-democratic principle to justify democratic inclusions should not however, be problematic in and of itself. Numerous normative principles rely on earlier, lower order ones to provide some form of moral foundation.  And a number of principles - nationalism; linguistic, cultural, and economic salience; geographical proximity; the status quo; and the all-affected principle - have been proposed as possible solutions.  Yet these proposals all fail when the claims of democratic legitimacy rely upon difference making.

Difference making lays at the heart of many accounts of democratic legitimacy.  According to these theories, a democratic state is legitimate precisely because it brings about different outcomes or states of affairs relative to non-democratic ones.  Inspired by Condorcet, epistemic accounts praise democracies _truth tracking_ abilities; strategic accounts claim democracies make better policy because the interests of all are considered; and personal autonomy accounts accept democracy as the best way to ensure fidelity between individual and collective interests.

But who makes up the people largely predetermines the outcome of a democratic process, irrespective of the particular democratic mechanism used.  The question of inclusion strips democratic processes of their difference making power and renders them either causally powerless.  The power of difference making is thus usurped by the principle of inclusion, a principle completely exogenous to extant democratic accounts.  The decisions and outcomes of democracies become attributable to the accidents of history, and thus erode any subsequent normative claims based on difference.


## Paradoxes of Procedure

In this chapter, I explore foundational paradoxes of procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy.  According to procedural accounts of democracy, legitimacy is derived from adherence or fidelity to some process or constitution.  But how can the creation of this constitution be legitimate when its creation proceeds its existence? How can a decision mechanism be agreed upon democratically?  The democratic method would be to deliberate or vote on the method but this requires some earlier agreement on what decision method will be used to answer this question.  

I also examine challenges raised by social choice theory such as Arrow's Impossibility Theory Condorcet's Paradox of Transitivity whereby seemingly 'irrational' intransitive collective or aggregated preferences arise from 'rational' transitive ones.  Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot overcome these foundational paradoxes without evolving into substantive or utopian accounts, which undermines their ability to imbue legitimacy.


## Limits of Liberalism

In this chapter, I explore the impossibility of contesting liberalism democratically.  According to liberal theory, legitimacy requires the protection of certain individual rights and freedoms.  But how can disagreement over the limits between public and private be decided on without undermining liberalism? Determining this limit collectively makes the question of what is a private right a public issue.  But determining the limit by some other means, say judicially, requires some earlier agreement on how the limit will be decided, and simply pushes the problem back one level.

Rawls, Gaus and other liberal theorists have proposed variants of liberal theory such as public reason.  These mechanisms however, appear endorse contractions in what values or policies liberal democracies should hold, or arbitrarily endorse values depending on the order they are debated. 


## Bootstrapping Democracy

In this chapter, I explore whether democracy can solve these problems by picking itself up from its own theoretical bootstraps. Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot recover from founding paradoxes without turning into utopian or substantive accounts.  Substantive accounts seem unable to simultaneously underpin democratic legitimacy and solve the boundary problem. But what if we could develop an account where adherence to the process is also the realisation of the substantive ideal? We would then have a potential way to bootstrap our way out of these dilemmas.  We would be able to bootstrap democracy.

My starting point is the identification of what exactly democratic theory needs to justify in order to claim legitimacy.  Here, I argue that unlike accounts based on affect or coercion, democratic theory only needs to justify its political authority - the moral obligation to be obeyed _simply_ because it is commanded.


## Reciprocal Autonomy

In this chapter, I develop the normative foundations of my solution to the Bootstrap Paradox.  I identify autonomy as a self-realising foundation that can exist simply by its assertion.  I argue that recognising the autonomy of others and therefore their claim to self rule, on the proviso that they recognise ours, is the minimum requirement for political cooperation and once accepted, both underpins our own claims of self determination whilst limiting our claims over others. 


## Dynamic Federalism

In this chapter, I develop a framework for realising the basic unit of political association.  The Principle of Reciprocal Autonomy provides a necessary, but not sufficient condition for solving the Bootstrap Paradox.  I show how a dynamic system of overlapping jurisdictions allows us to realise political association without succumbing to the earlier paradoxes I explore.
