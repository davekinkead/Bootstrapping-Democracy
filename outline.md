# Thesis Outline

Democracy is everywhere.  As a system of government, democracy has become the preeminent form of political association throughout the world.  Those without democracy struggle for it, while those with democracy struggle to maintain it.  As a political theory, the legitimisation of political authority with democracy is pervasive.  Arguments pertaining to the strengths and weaknesses, the pros and cons, and the trials and tribulations of democracy are ubiquitous throughout political discourse.  

Yet despite this omnipresence, questions concerning the existential nature of democracy are seldom addressed by political theorists and philosophers.  Democracy in its broadest sense is a way for people to make collectively binding rules to govern parts of their lives.  But this definition leaves out a great deal:  To which people are we referring when we talk about the _rule of the people_?  What rules are permissible?  To which part of their lives can they apply?

_Bootstrapping Democracy_ is an examination of the existential challenges that democratic theory faces - foundational paradoxes and problems that seep up and undermine subsequent accounts of democratic authority.  The question I am attempting to answer is this:

> How do the existential issues of inclusion, scope, and realisation affect justifications of democratic authority?

<<<<<<< HEAD
I identify and outline a number of existential problems that democracy faces - paradoxes of procedures, the limits of liberalism, and problems of democratic inclusion - that collectively form what I call the _Bootstrap Paradox_ - the inability of democracy to justify itself democratically.  I argue that no account democracy constrained by the existing conception of nation states with their claims of exclusive territorial sovereignty can be internally consistent and coherent.  As such, I use the Bootstrap Paradox to argue that because actual democracies cannot be _justified_ by any account of democracy, democratic theory can only be used to _rationalise_ particular political power structures.  The noble claims of willing consent, epistemic virtue, and beneficial consequences made by various democratic accounts are in the end just vacuous sophistry, serving only to ensure the smooth acquiescence of the demos to existing power structures.

## Democracy & Justification

Democracy is the preeminent form of political association of our times, and given the meteoric rise in the transition to democratic rule over the last 50 years, one might expect that the reasons for this would be clear enough; that the justifications of democratic rule would warrant wide consensus; or that debate concerning the nature of democratic legitimacy might be largely settled.  Yet even a cursory survey of political thought reveals that justifications of democracy are anything but widely accepted.  The vast literature of democratic theory proposes a wide and divergent range of accounts attempting to explain the authority of democratic regimes and our obligations as citizens to them.  

The apparent failure of democratic theory to provide an agreed upon, or even coherent account of democratic authority and its legitimacy points to challenge that few theorists are prepared to acknowledge - that no broad agreement on an account justifying democratic authority currently exists because no account adequately justifying democratic authority can in fact exist.  If contemporary democratic theory cannot justify democratic authority, then it can only rationalise it. I examine what it means for a theory to justify political authority and that a failure to do so means would mean democracy serves only as an elegant sophistry for the masses, a post-hoc rationalisation of political power structures the fail to equally benefit all those subject to its claims.  If politics is only about power, then democratic theory would simply be the rationalisation of one particular distribution of power.

## Defining Democracy

_Democracy_ is an essentially contested term.  In the political discourse of daily life, it is common to witness contradictory claims being justified as _democratic_.  Even within democratic theory, many scholars conflate democracy with the related but distinct notions of liberty, equality, voting, deliberation, and political participation.  But these conflations undermine accounts and criticisms of democratic legitimacy by failing to engage with the issues at hand and results in us talking past, rather than to, each other.

Politics is about power and democracy, like any _-ocracy_, is simply a description of who wields that power.  From it's etymological foundation, the rule of the many, I clarify the essential nature of democracy and strip it of normative content, arguing that any political system where power is wielded by those whom it is wielded over is justified claiming democracy as its name.  From there, I develop a rich taxonomy of democratic predicates that rejects the simplistic dualisms and false dichotomies found in much of contemporary democratic literature.  I show how democracy can be illiberal and totalitarian, participatory but not deliberative, or even characterised by a complete absence of voting.  Finally, I show that while many predicated forms of democracy might be desirable, democracy itself is not a virtue.


## The Problem of the People

Democracy begins with the people.  The _demos_ is the _kratos_, _praxis_, and _telos_ of the state.  Democratic theory presupposes the existence of a determinate polity of people who organise together and govern themselves.  Yet the matter of _who_ ought be included amongst the people is a matter both logically and temporally prior to that of _how_ they ought govern.  The question of who must consent, who ought be heard, or who should be entitled to vote, cannot be answered democratically without first knowing who to ask.  Democracy - the rule of, for, and by the people - simply cannot answer the fundamental issue of which people should be governed under which state.  Who ought make up the people can therefore only be answered by some pre- or non-democratic principle.

Reliance upon some extra-democratic principle to justify democratic inclusions should not however, be problematic in and of itself. Numerous normative principles rely on earlier, lower order ones to provide some form of moral foundation.  And a number of principles - nationalism; linguistic, cultural, and economic salience; geographical proximity; the status quo; and the all-affected principle - have been proposed as possible solutions.  Yet these proposals all fail when the claims of democratic legitimacy rely upon difference making.

Difference making lays at the heart of many accounts of democratic legitimacy.  According to these theories, a democratic state is legitimate precisely because it brings about different outcomes or states of affairs relative to non-democratic ones.  Inspired by Condorcet, epistemic accounts praise democracies _truth tracking_ abilities; strategic accounts claim democracies make better policy because the interests of all are considered; and personal autonomy accounts accept democracy as the best way to ensure fidelity between individual and collective interests.

But who makes up the people largely predetermines the outcome of a democratic process, irrespective of the particular democratic mechanism used.  The question of inclusion strips democratic processes of their difference making power and renders them either causally powerless.  The power of difference making is thus usurped by the principle of inclusion, a principle completely exogenous to extant democratic accounts.  The decisions and outcomes of democracies become attributable to the accidents of history, and thus erode any subsequent normative claims based on difference.


## Paradoxes of Procedure

According to many accounts of democracy, the legitimacy of any democratic outcome and the source of its authority, is derived from adherence to or fidelity with some process or procedure.  Our moral obligations to obey the commands of the government stem from the manner in which it was created.  Policies are legitimated the processes used to create them, governments are legitimated by the process they are elected by, and these processes are legitimated by some foundational process, a constitution, or _grundnorm_.

But how can the creation of this first procedure or constitution be legitimated when its creation proceeds its existence? The obvious answer would be to create it democratically but how can this be done without an earlier procedure?  All democratic outcomes require some agreed upon process in order to reconcile disagreement

How can a decision mechanism be agreed upon democratically?  The democratic method would be to deliberate or vote on the method but this requires some earlier agreement on what decision method will be used to answer this question.  

I also examine challenges raised by social choice theory such as Arrow's Impossibility Theory Condorcet's Paradox of Transitivity whereby seemingly 'irrational' intransitive collective or aggregated preferences arise from 'rational' transitive ones.  Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot overcome these foundational paradoxes without evolving into substantive or utopian accounts, which undermines their ability to imbue legitimacy.


## Limits of Liberalism

As the _rule of the people_, democracy requires requires constraints to its power in order to remain democratic.  Absent these constraints, democratic rule is infamous for its habit of degenerating into tyranny and despotism.  And for much of its history, those constraints have been liberal in the form of _liberal democracy_ - the system of government associated with the free and fair election of the legislative and executive branches, the rule of law, and constitutional checks and balances that limit the power of government and protect the individual freedoms and rights of the people.

According to liberal theory, political legitimacy requires the protection of certain individual rights and freedoms. But how can disagreement over the limits between public and private be decided on without undermining liberalism? Determining this limit collectively makes the question of what is a private right a public issue. But determining the limit by some other means, say judicially, requires some earlier agreement on how the limit will be decided, and simply pushes the problem back one level.

In this chapter, I explore the impossibility of reconciling liberalism democratically or without imposition and argue that while democracy requires liberalism, the reasonable pluralism that liberalism entails can never be reconciled.  


## Bootstrapping Democracy

In this chapter, I explore whether democracy can solve these problems by picking itself up from its own theoretical bootstraps. Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot recover from founding paradoxes without turning into utopian or substantive accounts.  Substantive accounts seem unable to simultaneously underpin democratic legitimacy and solve the boundary problem. But what if we could develop an account where adherence to the process is also the realisation of the substantive ideal? We would then have a potential way to bootstrap our way out of these dilemmas.  We would be able to bootstrap democracy.

My starting point is the identification of what exactly democratic theory needs to justify in order to claim legitimacy.  Here, I argue that unlike accounts based on affect or coercion, democratic theory only needs to justify its political authority - the moral obligation to be obeyed _simply_ because it is commanded.  From there, I identify which conditions must be realised, and which must be relaxed, in order to generate a coherent account of democratic authority.
