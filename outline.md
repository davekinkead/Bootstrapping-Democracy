# Thesis Outline

## Introduction

This is an argument about democratic authority.  About why and whether we have reasons to act as directed by democratic governments.

I'm going to defend the thesis that if political authority requires justification, then democracy cannot justify political authority.

And I'm going to do this by showing that three existential paradoxes of democratic theory - paradoxes relating to the who, what, and how of democratic activity - undermine even the most minimal accounts of political justification.

My conclusion will be that democratic states, at least as we know them, can never justify their claims to authority but only rationalise them.


## Defining Democracy

Democracy can be described descriptively. These accounts try to show what democracy is.

But it can also be described normatively. These accounts try to show why democracy has value.

## Authority & Justification

What is authority? It is having content independent & pre-emptive reasons for others to act. It is to take action just because someone one believes to have authority said so.

How can authority be justified?

  - permissible vs ideal vs obligating justifications
  - green, simmons, hobbes

But what does it mean to justify?

  - epistemic requirements of justification

For democracy to justify political authority, it must show why the orders of democratic states give us reasons for actions, without reference to the content of those orders, and in a way that pre-empts other countervailing reasons for actions. 


## Confusion over Consent

Consent the most obvious way we can place obligations on ourselves.  If moral obligations do exist, then consent is sufficient to impose them.

Accounts of democracy have a long history of using consent to justify political authority. But these accounts have not been without problems.

  - historical review of consent: Crito, Hobbes, Locke, Hume.

Consent requires the possibility of non-consent to be meaningful.  Unless the costs of non-consent are independently justified, then any claim to consent will be coercive.

But states claim authority without the consent of all members.  To impose the costs of non-consent requires an independent justification of authority.

Consent cannot be this independent justification. And if an independent justification to impose the costs of non-consent exists, then consent to justify political authority becomes redundant.

So because the sovereign claims of the state do not permit non-consent, consent to political authority cannot be given.


## The Problem of the People

Consequentialist accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.

These processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes.

So any consequential account of democratic authority needs to provide a corresponding account of democratic inclusion.

But there is considerable debate about over who the people should be. There are no clear answers.  This is the Boundary Problem.

Furthermore, different consequentialist accounts of democracy require different accounts of democratic inclusion.  

These accounts of inclusion are incompatible with each other rendering different consequentialist accounts of democracy incompatible.

So without a compatible and coherent account of democratic inclusion, consequential accounts of democratic authority are rendered vacuous.

  - possible inclusion of how this affects intrinsic accounts of democracy


## Liberalism and its Limits

Democracy requires limits. Without constraints to the scope of democratic authority, naked majoritarianism can quickly descend into tyranny.

Democracy without limits also lacks value. 

  - illustrate with the thought experiment of democratic totalitarianism

Constitutional liberalism is typically offered as the solution. By specifying a set of rights that cannot be infringed by the majority, tyranny is held at bay.

Liberalism requires a priority of rights.  Some rights are incompatible with others. But there will always be reasonable disagreement about the priority of rights in liberal societies.

No objective account of optimal liberty exists.  Even if it did exist, it is quite possible that there would be a set of equally optimal but incompatible priorities of rights.

This disagreement cannot be solved democratically.  To do so would be to replace liberal constraints with (super) majoritarianism.

But doesn't constitutional majoritarianism act as a hand-break to tyranny?  Yes but this then undermines substantive justifications of democracy.

  - democracy as freedom can't be justified when the majority can override specific rights
  - democracy as equality can't be justified when the majority can override procedural and substantive equality


## Paradoxes of Procedure

Every realisation of democracy must have some agreed upon way of making decisions.

Many of the most common democratic procedures are incoherent in that they can't satisfy the criteria of democratic fairness.

  - lit review of social choice theory and voting paradoxes.

Even if they can be shown to be fair, different procedures produce different outcomes.  Those different outcomes affect citizens differently.  Disagreement about which procedure to use is inevitable.

How do we reconcile these disagreements?  Using any democratic procedure results in an infinite regress.

And neither can we consent to them if the results are binding on those who don't consent.
