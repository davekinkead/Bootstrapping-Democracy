# Thesis Outline

## Introduction

This is an argument about democratic authority.  About why and whether we have reasons to act as directed by democratic governments.

I'm going to defend the thesis that if political authority requires justification, then democracy cannot justify political authority.

And I'm going to do this by showing that three existential paradoxes of democratic theory - paradoxes relating to the who, what, and how of democratic activity - undermine even the most minimal accounts of political justification.

My conclusion will be that democratic states, at least as we know them, can never justify their claims to authority but can only rationalise them.


## Defining Democracy

Democracy can be described descriptively or normatively. While many accounts are descriptive, they often have normative elements.

Of the normative accounts, some simply assume democracy to be required and attempt to show what form is best, while others do not and attempt to justify democracy ab initio.

Democracy can be described descriptively. These accounts try to show what democracy is.

  - descriptive vs normative
  - assumes democracy vs justifies democracy

Lit review of descriptive characterisations of democratic

  - Aristotle
  - Madison & Hamilton
  - Dahl
  - Tilly

But it can also be described normatively. These accounts try to show why democracy has value.

Lit review of normative accounts

  - Condorcet, List and Goodin. 2001: Democracy has value because majority voting tracks the truth under certain conditions.

  - Estund 1997: Democracy has value because it is has a fair procedure and yields the best results.

  - Arneson 2004: Democracy isn't intrinsically just. It has value because it is (contingently and uncertainly) the best system for realising justice.

  - Frey and Stutzer 2005: People value political participation. Democracy has value because it increases utility not just from good policy but also by allowing people to participate.

  - Cohen 2002: Laws and policies are legitimate to the extent that they are publicly justified to the citizens of the community.

  - Singer 1973: Democracy is a peaceful and fair compromise the conflicting desires of everyone's dictatorial rule.

  - Schumpter 1956: Responsible elites competing for the peoples vote is the best way to distribute power in the public interest. 

  - Mill 1861: Democracy has value because it considers everyone's interests, more reliable for making the right decisions, and transforms the moral character of participants.

  - Elster 1986: "The task of politics is not only to eliminate inefficiency [as in markets], but also to create justice--a goal to which the aggregation of political preferences is a quite incongruous means"

  - Sen 1999: Democracy has value because it promotes policies that improve the well being of citizens and allows them to shape the norms and values of that well being.

  - Rousseau: A general will is necessary for legitimate authority. Democracy has value because it discovers the general will in a manor that is equal and universal.

  - Gould 1988: Democracy is valuable because only it can give individuals a chance of self government.

  - Rawls 1971: Justice demands a liberal and egalitarian democracy.

  - Rorty

  - Christiano 2004:

  - Buchanan & Tullock 1965: Elites will expand their power and create inefficient government, so more social functions should be performed by the market.

  - Plato: The people lack the necessary expertise for ruling so elites should rule.


  - will of the people

  - self determination/check on abuse of power  

  - promotes freedom

  - embodies freedom

  - promotes equality

  - embodies equality




Highlight the key features of any minimalist conception of democracy and outline my conception. Something along the lines of "collective autonomy characterised by political equality".


## Authority & Justification

What is authority? Authority is the giving of content independent & pre-emptive reasons for others to act. It is to take action just because someone one believes to have authority said so.

  - de facto vs dejure
  - internal vs external
  - right to rule vs obligation to obey vs justification for action.

How can authority be justified?

  - the difference between permissible vs ideal vs obligating justifications
  - associate obligations
  - transactional obligations
  - natural duty obligations

But what does it mean to justify?

  - epistemic requirements of justification
  - reasons for belief
  - coherence & non-contradiction

So any account of political authority must show

  - it gives moral reasons for action
  - they are content independent
  - they are binding on subject
  - that subjects are bound to particular states
  - that all subjects must obey all laws.

For democracy to justify political authority, it must show why the orders of democratic states give us reasons for actions, without reference to the content of those orders, and in a way that pre-empts other countervailing reasons for actions. 
  

## Confusion over Consent

Consent is the most obvious way we can place obligations on ourselves.  If moral obligations do exist, then consent is sufficient to impose them.

  - how do obligations come to be
  - promises vs duties vs obligations
  - define consent

Accounts of democracy have a long history of using consent to justify political authority. But these accounts have not been without problems.

  - historical review of consent: Crito, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant.
  - voting vs tacit vs hypothetical

Consent changes moral relationships between parties. Typically from permission to obligation or from prohibition to permission.  Voting doesn't change the relationship between voters and the state.  Therefore voting cannot be consent.

Birth or naturalisation do change moral relationships, so these could be valid instances of consent. Consent though, requires the possibility of non-consent to be meaningful.  Unless the costs of non-consent are independently justified, then any claim to consent will be coercive.

But states claim authority without the consent of all members.  To impose the costs of non-consent requires an independent justification of authority.

Consent cannot be this independent justification. And if an independent justification to impose the costs of non-consent exists, then consent to justify political authority becomes redundant.

  - address Frankfurt's free will objection: you may have consented but they state cannot claim or show that you have consented.

Neither can hypothetical consent create obligations.  The an essential element of consent is its voluntary nature.  Counterfactual claims - you ought have consented - do not have this voluntary element so they cannot be consent.  The normative work must come from someone else, so hypothetical consent theories are really natural duty or associative obligation theories.

So because the sovereign claims of the state do not permit non-consent, consent to political authority cannot be given (so long as the state is non-voluntary).

## The Problem of the People

Consequentialist accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.

These processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes.

So any consequential account of democratic authority needs to provide a corresponding account of democratic inclusion.

But there is considerable debate about over who the people should be. There are no clear answers.  This is the Boundary Problem.

Furthermore, different consequentialist accounts of democracy require different accounts of democratic inclusion.  

These accounts of inclusion are incompatible with each other rendering different consequentialist accounts of democracy incompatible.

So without a compatible and coherent account of democratic inclusion, consequential accounts of democratic authority are rendered vacuous.

  - possible inclusion of how this affects intrinsic accounts of democracy


## Liberalism and its Limits

Democracy requires limits. Without constraints to the scope of democratic authority, naked majoritarianism can quickly descend into tyranny.

  - Democracy may require some limits to protect political expression and function (free speech & association)
  - Liberalism goes beyond this (freedom of religion, sexual expression etc)

Democracy without limits also lacks value. 

  - illustrate with the thought experiment of democratic totalitarianism

Constitutional liberalism is typically offered as the solution. By specifying a set of rights that cannot be infringed by the majority, tyranny is held at bay.

Liberalism requires a priority of rights.  Some rights are incompatible with others. But there will always be reasonable disagreement about the priority of rights in liberal societies.

No objective account of optimal liberty exists.  Even if it did exist, it is quite possible that there would be a set of equally optimal but incompatible priorities of rights.

This disagreement cannot be solved democratically.  To do so would be to replace liberal constraints with (super) majoritarianism.

But doesn't constitutional majoritarianism act as a hand-break to tyranny?  Yes but this then undermines substantive justifications of democracy.

  - democracy as freedom can't be justified when the majority can override specific rights
  - democracy as equality can't be justified when the majority can override procedural and substantive equality


## Paradoxes of Procedure

Every realisation of democracy must have some agreed upon way of making decisions.

Many of the most common democratic procedures are incoherent in that they can't satisfy the criteria of democratic fairness.

  - lit review of social choice theory and voting paradoxes.

Even if they can be shown to be fair, different procedures produce different outcomes.  Those different outcomes affect citizens differently.  Disagreement about which procedure to use is inevitable.

How do we reconcile these disagreements?  Using any democratic procedure results in an infinite regress.

And neither can we consent to them if the results are binding on those who don't consent.
