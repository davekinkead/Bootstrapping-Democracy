# Thesis Outline

## Introduction

This is an argument about democratic authority.  About why and whether we have reasons to act as directed by democratic governments.

I'm going to defend the thesis that if political authority requires justification, then democracy cannot justify political authority.

And I'm going to do this by showing that three existential paradoxes of democratic theory - paradoxes relating to the who, what, and how of democratic activity - undermine even the most minimal accounts of political justification.

My conclusion will be that democratic states, at least as we know them, can never justify their claims to authority but can only rationalise them.


## Authority & Justification

What's the difference between the state and the mafia?  There are some obvious ones: size, ethnic heritage, access to resources etc.  But let's ignore these for a moment and focus on more relevant descriptive and normative criteria.  Both groups exercise power over particular geographical areas.  Both groups offer a non-voluntary policing and protection service.  Both groups extract rents in return for that service.  And both groups use violence against those they ostensibly claim to serve in order to further their aims.

The key difference between the state and the mafia then, is normative.  While both claim power and want obedience, and while we have strong prudential reasons for obeying bother, only in the case of the state do we have independent extra-prudential reasons for compliance.  We have moral reasons to support and obey the state whereas we might have moral reasons to activity thwart the mafia.  This is what we mean by political authority.

Political authority is what gives us reasons to obey the state.  But not just any reason will do.  We might have moral duties towards other citizens or governments for a variety of reasons but only some of these reasons stem from political authority.  Some of these other reasons are universal moral duties to all people. Other reasons might be purely prudential - the difference between de jure and de facto authority (examine Webber here).  These reasons might be internally or externally imposed.

It is only a special type of moral reason for action that constitutes legitimate political authority.  This can be interpreted as the right to rule vs the obligation to obey vs a justification for action.  Authority as the right to rule captures too little of the concept.  Ruling becomes vacuous if there is no corresponding obligation to obey.  Authority as a justification for action however captures too much.  There might be many situations when a state's actions against a people are justified but they lack authority over those people.  Unilateral responses to externalities like climate change, or encroachment into a neutral party's territory during war are some examples of this.  Only when people have obligations to obey, may we say that those with the corresponding right to rule have authority.

Following from @green our working definition of legitimate or _de jure_ authority might be something like this.

> Someone or something has authority when their giving of content independent & pre-emptive reasons for action is sufficient to generate obligations of obedience.  When a subject has sufficient reasons to take action just because someone one believes to have authority said so.

So any account of political authority must show that (following @green and @simmons):

  - it gives subjects moral reasons for obeying
  - those reasons are content independent
  - those reasons are binding on subject
  - that all subjects must obey all laws.
  - that subjects are bound to particular states

So how can political authority be justified?  Or stated another way, under what conditions is authority _legitimate_? A first step is to distinguish between justifications that generate permissibility, obligation, and the ideal.  Another step is to examine types of moral obligations - associate, transactional, and natural duty obligation. 

Next, we must examine what it means to justify something.  While my claim is that we must believe the state has authority, does any belief count?  Here I segway to another critique of Webber and show why unfounded beliefs, contradictory or incoherent beliefs, or state brainwashing are insufficient for justifying authority.
  
We must believe the state has political authority for the right reasons. We need to know that our beliefs are warranted.  A number of accounts of when our beliefs are warranted _warrant_ are available.  @rawls offers public justification. A belief is warranted when it is supported by reasons that reasonable people would reasonably accept. This account is too strong however - it requires too much.  It fails to adequately address a criteria for reasonableness which has lead to significant debate (see @quong & @gaus).  In contrast, @rorty offers us anti-foundationalism. But this account is too weak.  It doesn't place sufficient demands on the quality of belief or its transmission.

Instead, I propose we adopt a minimalist account of the epistemic requirements of political justification - warranted transmission:

>  A subject s's justification for belief p based on evidence e transmits to p's logical consequence belief q iff:  
>
>    i)   s has justification for believing p based on e,  
>    ii)  s knows that q is deducible from p, and  
>    iii) s has justification for believing q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).  

Logical consequence is the key here.  It eliminates incoherent or contradictory beliefs while being truth agnostic.  It means that validity in prior to posterior belief is a necessary condition for political authority.  And the consequence of this is that any account of political authority which is invalid cannot warrant the belief that that authority is legitimate.

We now have a framework for analysing democratic authority in the rest of this thesis.  Democratic authority may be rationalised - by offering reasons to make it tolerable _post hoc_.  Democratic authority may be vindicated - by showing that certain desirable states of affairs are a probable consequent of it (see @cohen1971). Or democratic authority may be justified - shown to be legitimate by offering reasons that are warranted.

I will show that no current account of democracy can justify political authority.


## Defining Democracy

Democracy can be described descriptively or normatively. While many accounts are descriptive, they often have normative elements.

Of the normative accounts, some simply assume democracy to be required and attempt to show what form is best, while others do not and attempt to justify democracy ab initio.

Democracy can be described descriptively. These accounts try to show what democracy is.

  - descriptive vs normative
  - assumes democracy vs justifies democracy

Lit review of descriptive characterisations of democratic

  - Aristotle
  - Madison & Hamilton
  - Dahl
  - Tilly

But it can also be described normatively. These accounts try to show why democracy has value.

Highlight the key features of any minimalist conception of democracy and outline my conception. Something along the lines of "collective autonomy characterised by political equality".


## Confusion over Consent

Consent is the most obvious way we can place obligations on ourselves.  If moral obligations do exist, then consent is sufficient to impose them.

  - how do obligations come to be
  - promises vs duties vs obligations
  - define consent

Accounts of democracy have a long history of using consent to justify political authority. But these accounts have not been without problems.

  - historical review of consent: Crito, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant.
  - voting vs tacit vs hypothetical

Consent changes moral relationships between parties. Typically from permission to obligation or from prohibition to permission.  Voting doesn't change the relationship between voters and the state.  Therefore voting cannot be consent.

Birth or naturalisation might change moral relationships however, so these could be valid instances of consent. Consent though, requires the possibility of non-consent to be meaningful.  Unless the costs of non-consent are independently justified, then any claim to consent will be coercive and thus invalidated.

But states claim authority without the consent of all members.  To impose the costs of non-consent requires an independent justification of authority.  If the state has this independent justification, then consent as a means to justify political authority becomes redundant.  And if however consent is necessary to justify the states authority to impose the costs of non-consent, then the argument is circular.

  - address Frankfurt's free will objection: you may have consented but they state cannot claim or show that you have consented.

Neither can hypothetical consent create obligations.  The an essential element of consent is its voluntary nature.  Counterfactual claims - you ought have consented - do not have this voluntary element so they cannot be consent.  The normative work must come from someone else, so hypothetical consent theories are really natural duty or associative obligation theories.

So because the sovereign claims of the state do not permit non-consent, consent to political authority cannot be given (so long as the state is non-voluntary).


## The Problem of the People

Consequentialist accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.

These processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes.

So any consequential account of democratic authority needs to provide a corresponding account of democratic inclusion.

But there is considerable debate about over who the people should be. There are no clear answers.  This is the Boundary Problem.

Furthermore, different consequentialist accounts of democracy require different accounts of democratic inclusion.  

These accounts of inclusion are incompatible with each other rendering different consequentialist accounts of democracy incompatible.

So without a compatible and coherent account of democratic inclusion, consequential accounts of democratic authority are rendered vacuous.

  - possible inclusion of how this affects intrinsic accounts of democracy


## Liberalism and its Limits

Democracy requires limits. Without constraints to the scope of democratic authority, naked majoritarianism can quickly descend into tyranny.

  - Democracy may require some limits to protect political expression and function (free speech & association)
  - Liberalism goes beyond this (freedom of religion, sexual expression etc)

Democracy without limits also lacks value. 

  - illustrate with the thought experiment of democratic totalitarianism

Constitutional liberalism is typically offered as the solution. By specifying a set of rights that cannot be infringed by the majority, tyranny is held at bay.

Liberalism requires a priority of rights.  Some rights are incompatible with others. But there will always be reasonable disagreement about the priority of rights in liberal societies.

No objective account of optimal liberty exists.  Even if it did exist, it is quite possible that there would be a set of equally optimal but incompatible priorities of rights.

This disagreement cannot be solved democratically.  To do so would be to replace liberal constraints with (super) majoritarianism.

But doesn't constitutional majoritarianism act as a hand-break to tyranny?  Yes but this then undermines substantive justifications of democracy.

  - democracy as freedom can't be justified when the majority can override specific rights
  - democracy as equality can't be justified when the majority can override procedural and substantive equality


## Paradoxes of Procedure

Every realisation of democracy must have some agreed upon way of making decisions.

Many of the most common democratic procedures are incoherent in that they can't satisfy the criteria of democratic fairness.

  - lit review of social choice theory and voting paradoxes.

Even if they can be shown to be fair, different procedures produce different outcomes.  Those different outcomes affect citizens differently.  Disagreement about which procedure to use is inevitable.

How do we reconcile these disagreements?  Using any democratic procedure results in an infinite regress.

And neither can we consent to them if the results are binding on those who don't consent.
