# Thesis Outline

## Introduction

This is an argument about democratic authority.  About why and whether we have reasons to act as directed by democratic governments.

I'm going to defend the thesis that if political authority requires justification, then democracy cannot justify political authority.

And I'm going to do this by showing that three existential paradoxes of democratic theory - paradoxes relating to the who, what, and how of democratic activity - undermine even the most minimal accounts of political justification.

My conclusion will be that democratic states, at least as we know them, can never justify their claims to authority but can only rationalise them.


## Defining Democracy

Democracy can be described descriptively or normatively. While many accounts are descriptive, they often have normative elements.

Of the normative accounts, some simply assume democracy to be required and attempt to show what form is best, while others do not and attempt to justify democracy ab initio.

Democracy can be described descriptively. These accounts try to show what democracy is.

  - descriptive vs normative
  - assumes democracy vs justifies democracy

Lit review of descriptive characterisations of democratic

  - Aristotle
  - Madison & Hamilton
  - Dahl
  - Tilly

But it can also be described normatively. These accounts try to show why democracy has value.

Highlight the key features of any minimalist conception of democracy and outline my conception. Something along the lines of "collective autonomy characterised by political equality".


## Authority & Justification

What is political authority? Political authority is what gives us reasons to obey the state.  But not just any reason will do.  We might have moral duties towards other citizens or governments for a variety of reasons but only some of these reasons stem from political authority.

Some of these other reasons are universal moral duties to all people. Other reasons might be purely prudential - the difference between de jure and de facto authority (examine Webber).  These reasons might be internally or externally imposed.

It is only a special type of moral reason for action that constitutes legitimate political authority.  This can be interpreted as the right to rule vs the obligation to obey vs a justification for action.

Someone or something has authority when their giving of content independent & pre-emptive reasons for action is sufficient to generate obligations of obedience.  It is to take action just because someone one believes to have authority said so.

So how can political authority be justified?

  - the difference between permissible vs ideal vs obligating justifications
  - associate obligations
  - transactional obligations
  - natural duty obligations

But what does it mean to justify?

  - epistemic requirements of justification
  - reasons for belief
  - coherence & non-contradiction

While the claim here is that we must believe the state has authority, does any belief count?

  - visit Webber and the idea that any belief will do.
  - why is this bad? Poor beliefs, contradictory beliefs, state Brainwashing...

So we must believe the state has political authority for the right reasons. We need to know that our beliefs are warranted.  Let's look at some potential candidates for when our beliefs are warranted.

  - Rawls offers us public justification. Reasons that reasonable people would reasonably accept. Demonstrate why this is too strong a criteria.

  - Rorty offers us anti-foundationalism. Demonstrate why this is too weak a criteria.

So any account of political authority must show that:

  - it gives moral reasons for obeying
  - they are content independent
  - they are binding on subject
  - that all subjects must obey all laws.
  - that subjects are bound to particular states

For democracy to justify political authority, it must show why the orders of democratic states give us reasons for actions, without reference to the content of those orders, and in a way that pre-empts other countervailing reasons for actions. 
  
  - vindication vs justification vs rationalisation

## Confusion over Consent

Consent is the most obvious way we can place obligations on ourselves.  If moral obligations do exist, then consent is sufficient to impose them.

  - how do obligations come to be
  - promises vs duties vs obligations
  - define consent

Accounts of democracy have a long history of using consent to justify political authority. But these accounts have not been without problems.

  - historical review of consent: Crito, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant.
  - voting vs tacit vs hypothetical

Consent changes moral relationships between parties. Typically from permission to obligation or from prohibition to permission.  Voting doesn't change the relationship between voters and the state.  Therefore voting cannot be consent.

Birth or naturalisation might change moral relationships however, so these could be valid instances of consent. Consent though, requires the possibility of non-consent to be meaningful.  Unless the costs of non-consent are independently justified, then any claim to consent will be coercive and thus invalidated.

But states claim authority without the consent of all members.  To impose the costs of non-consent requires an independent justification of authority.  If the state has this independent justification, then consent as a means to justify political authority becomes redundant.  And if however consent is necessary to justify the states authority to impose the costs of non-consent, then the argument is circular.

  - address Frankfurt's free will objection: you may have consented but they state cannot claim or show that you have consented.

Neither can hypothetical consent create obligations.  The an essential element of consent is its voluntary nature.  Counterfactual claims - you ought have consented - do not have this voluntary element so they cannot be consent.  The normative work must come from someone else, so hypothetical consent theories are really natural duty or associative obligation theories.

So because the sovereign claims of the state do not permit non-consent, consent to political authority cannot be given (so long as the state is non-voluntary).


## The Problem of the People

Consequentialist accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.

These processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes.

So any consequential account of democratic authority needs to provide a corresponding account of democratic inclusion.

But there is considerable debate about over who the people should be. There are no clear answers.  This is the Boundary Problem.

Furthermore, different consequentialist accounts of democracy require different accounts of democratic inclusion.  

These accounts of inclusion are incompatible with each other rendering different consequentialist accounts of democracy incompatible.

So without a compatible and coherent account of democratic inclusion, consequential accounts of democratic authority are rendered vacuous.

  - possible inclusion of how this affects intrinsic accounts of democracy


## Liberalism and its Limits

Democracy requires limits. Without constraints to the scope of democratic authority, naked majoritarianism can quickly descend into tyranny.

  - Democracy may require some limits to protect political expression and function (free speech & association)
  - Liberalism goes beyond this (freedom of religion, sexual expression etc)

Democracy without limits also lacks value. 

  - illustrate with the thought experiment of democratic totalitarianism

Constitutional liberalism is typically offered as the solution. By specifying a set of rights that cannot be infringed by the majority, tyranny is held at bay.

Liberalism requires a priority of rights.  Some rights are incompatible with others. But there will always be reasonable disagreement about the priority of rights in liberal societies.

No objective account of optimal liberty exists.  Even if it did exist, it is quite possible that there would be a set of equally optimal but incompatible priorities of rights.

This disagreement cannot be solved democratically.  To do so would be to replace liberal constraints with (super) majoritarianism.

But doesn't constitutional majoritarianism act as a hand-break to tyranny?  Yes but this then undermines substantive justifications of democracy.

  - democracy as freedom can't be justified when the majority can override specific rights
  - democracy as equality can't be justified when the majority can override procedural and substantive equality


## Paradoxes of Procedure

Every realisation of democracy must have some agreed upon way of making decisions.

Many of the most common democratic procedures are incoherent in that they can't satisfy the criteria of democratic fairness.

  - lit review of social choice theory and voting paradoxes.

Even if they can be shown to be fair, different procedures produce different outcomes.  Those different outcomes affect citizens differently.  Disagreement about which procedure to use is inevitable.

How do we reconcile these disagreements?  Using any democratic procedure results in an infinite regress.

And neither can we consent to them if the results are binding on those who don't consent.
