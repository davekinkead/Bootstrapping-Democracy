Some starting thoughts and definitions...

Short thesis: Democracy can't be justified, only rationalised.

Long Thesis: If polity authority requires a coherent theory to be justified, then democratic theory can't justify political authority because democratic theory lacks coherence.

Political Authority: A power relationship characterised by the normative obligations of one group to obey, content independently and pre-emptively, the commands of another.

Coherent Theory (of authority):  Any non-contradictory line of reasoning that can demonstrate how obligations to political authority can arise an be maintained.

Democracy: A system of government characterised by popular sovereignty and political equality.

Democratic Theory: Any normative account of how democratic systems of government can give rise to political authority.

An Argument...

Because, Democracy!

## Political authority requires justification.  

Political theorists have long acknowledged the requirement of those in power to justify their position to those who seek to rule.  Whether feudalism, autocracy, or democracy, those seeking to rule have needed to give reasons why they should be obeyed. It is the fundamental principle of liberalism but also present in the divine right of kings and national destiny.

These justifications needs to be coherent if authority is to be legitimate.  Coherence requires firstly that any theory is non-contradictory, and second, that it does what it claims.  The justification of democratic authority therefore requires a non-contradictory line of reasoning that demonstrates citizens have content independent and pre-emptive obligations to obey democratic government.

Political realists however dispute any legitimating requirement.  The exercise of power merely requires the absence of opposition to it - the fatalistic acquiescence of the subject.  While this may be sufficient in some circumstances, the complexities of modern society, the scope of the modern state and the material challenges of purely coercive rule do seem require some form of willing obedience of the citizenry.

Willing acceptance of authority requires at least the belief that the authority is legitimate.  This belief however need not be correct. One could believe an authority to be legitimate despite it's reasons not satisfying the justification requirement.  Or one could believe an authority to be illegitimate despite it's reasons being fully justified.  What people do actually belief often differs from what they ought to rationally believe. I offer this claim then, that political authority requires justification, as a conditional.

For a democratic authority to be legitimate then, it must be justified.  It must show that it does in fact, generate content independent and pre-emptive reasons to be obeyed.

## Types of Justifications

Democratic authority has been justified in different ways




Democracy's Existential Challenges:


## The Problem of the People

Democracy - _dÄ“mokratia_ - means _the rule of the people_ but who exact are the people?  Democratic theory focuses almost exclusively on questions relating to the _kratos_ while largely ignoring questions related to the _demos_.  But who the people are, or more importantly who they should be, is a matter of fundamental importance for democratic legitimacy.

Some accounts of democracy justify its authority with reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.  Democratic processes track the truth, create good policy, realise individual preferences, or transform the moral character of citizens.  Democracy either realises these beneficial consequences, or does so better than competing systems of government, thereby legitimating the authority of the democratic state. 

But who the people are often predetermines the outcomes of democratic processes.  Within any society, and even more so between them, different people have different beliefs, competencies, values, and characters.  How these people are grouped together into democratic polities determines the degree of homogeneity of these characteristics within and between polities.  Forming these polities one way will very often lead to different political outcomes had they been formed another way, even when the characteristics of the people are held fixed.

For consequentialist accounts of democracy authority - justifications based on the quality of democratic outcomes - the role of democratic inclusion in determining democratic outcomes can severely undermine subsequent accounts of legitimacy.  Accounts of democratic inclusion - who the people should be - turn out to be causally responsible for the quality of democratic outcomes, regardless of the democratic processes used.  Accounts of democratic inclusion also need to justified for a democratic authority to be legitimate.

The challenge for democracy is that democratic theory cannot provide an account of democratic inclusion.  For any decision to be decided democratically, there must first be some group of people - the _demos_ - to do the deciding.  But who this _demos_ should be is the very question to be decided.  Attempting to answer the question of who the people ought be democratically is either viciously circular, or results in an infinite regress of identifying some earlier people to identify the people.


## The Limits of Limits

- democracy needs limits
  - without limits, democracy is just naked majoritarianism
  - naked majoritarianism quickly decends into tyranny
- those limits can't be determined democratically
  - if limits are arbitrary, then the scope of democracy is arbitrary and thus lacks legitimacy
  - if limits can be determined by majority decision,
