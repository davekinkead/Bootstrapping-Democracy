# Epistemic transmission and justified political belief

How do we arrive at particular political beliefs? That democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others.  That if only the experts were in charge the world would be a better place. Or the aristocracy. Or the clergy.

But wait - that's too descriptive a question to be philosophy. How _should_ we arrive at particular political beliefs?  What might justifiy those beliefs? How can we reliably move from one belief to another? When are our beliefs warranted and how might that warrant transfer between them? See - questions of normativity. That's more like it.

So I want to flesh out an account of what constitutes a justified political belief and of how that justification is transmitted from one set of beliefs to another.  

Judging political beliefs is especially challenging because we can't rely on traditional accounts of truth and knowledge.  One trouble is that so much of politics concerns questions of value and preference rather than questions of fact.  Of course truth plays a role by informing debate and constraining justifiable belief but the most contentious issues are those where incommensurable values collide - like the priority of equality or liberty; or the right vs the good.

So we are forced to rely on ephemeral foundations.  We (hopefully) identify one value or claim that we can accept as axiomatic in order to halt the regress of justification.  From this, we might then be able to infer subsequent beliefs.  But this of course leads to another trouble - how to we justify the inferential move from one belief to another? Epistemologists have a general account of epistemic transmission which might help [^tjw]:

>  A subject s's justification for belief p based on evidence e transmits to p's logical consequence belief q iff:  
>
>    i)   s has justification for believing p based on e,  
>    ii)  s knows that q is deducible from p, and  
>    iii) s has justification for believing q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).  

[^tjw]: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transmission-justification-warrant/

This account can be adapted quite nicely to capture political belief.  Let's start with what I'll call our political premise - the entailment relationship between _p_ and _q_.  This premise is the normative lever of our argument; it provides us with action guiding reasons _if_ it can be shown that the principle is to be invoked is ...

Let's begin by assuming that the political premise is true in virtue of some independent or axiomatic justification.  What might these political premises look like?

> If one consents to a political arrangement, then one has morally binding obligations towards it.

> Any decision procedure that accurately tracks the truth is sufficient to generate obligations to obey the decisions of that procedure.

> A power relation is just if it is at least minimally acceptable to all participants.

For the time being, let's assume that these political premises are true - that _s_ knows that _q_ is deducible from _p_.  Next, we have what we might call our evidential claim. These claims attempt to show that _s_ has justification for believing _p_ based on _e_:

> Voting is evidence of consent.

> Democratic processes accurately track the truth.

> The only power sharing arrangement that is minimally acceptable to all parties is democratic equality.

If that justification from _e_ is sufficient to believe _p_, then _q_ must follow.

> Voters have obligations to the state.

> Voters are morally bound to obey the outcomes of elections.

> Democracy is just.

So far so good but one thing seems to be missing here...

This notion of epistemic transmission behaves a lot like truth preservation does in logical validity.  It tells us when one belief is justified, or is entailed if you like, by another.

And it also gives us two vectors against which we can challenge a political belief - the evidential claim and the political claim.  

So how would this work?

One approach against an account of democratic consent would be to challenge the idea that voting is, or could ever be, evidence of consent.  That's because consent is a mechanism for changing the moral relationships between parties.  It changes the normative standing of certain actions from obligatory to permissible, or from permissible to prohibited.  

But our relation with the state doesn't seem to change when we vote. Regardless of the outcome of an election, we are still obliged to obey the state, or so it is claimed by defenders of this account.  If fact, we are still we are still obligated to obey the state whether or not we do vote in the election at all.  Thus, because voting doesn't change our obligations to the state and consent requires the capacity to change moral relations, voting cannot be evidence of consent.

So in this case, we might accept the political claim that consent can generate obligations, but deny the evidential claim that voting is consent. In the case of epistemic justifications of democracy however, we might want to challenge both claims.

Firstly, the claim that truth tracking is sufficient for an obligation to obey appears to be defeasible on a number of counts.  One might simply argue that knowledge about the state of the world is insufficiently action guiding - that an _is_ alone can't generate an _ought_.
