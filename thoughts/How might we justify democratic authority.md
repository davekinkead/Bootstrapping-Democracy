How might we justify democratic authority?

I take it as a uncontroversial claim that people can have moral obligations to obey certain political authorities[^1].  If we want to play cricket then we must simply accept the umpire's call.  A slightly more controversial claim however, is that we have moral obligations to obey democratic authorities.



[^1]: Some anarchists may beg to differ.  Robert Paul Wolff for example famously defends the incompatibility of moral autonomy and any obligation to authority.  The problem for Wollf and others is that there objections bite too deeply rendering even obligations to oneself such as promises as incompatible.
