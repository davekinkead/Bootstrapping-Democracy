# Dimensions of Democracy

There are a number of ways to characterise democracy.  Here are just a few....


## General Political Dimensions


### Source of power

This describes where political authority is (or claimed to be) derived from.  In whose name power is wielded in...

It can be described in relation to the group number or by reference to group characteristics

Number 

  - one (Monarchy)
  - few (Oligarchy)
  - many (polyarchy)
  - all (panarchy) 

Characteristic 

  - god (thearchy)
  - wealthy (plutarchy)


### Locus of power

Who does the actual ruling.  Who wields power....

Number

  - one (autocracy)
  - few (oligocracy)
  - many (polyocracy)
  - all (panocracy) 

Characteristics

  - the best (aristocracy)
  - priests (theocracy)
  - wealthy (plutocracy)
  - the people (democracy)
  - the military (stratocracy)


### Scope of power

This dimension describes the scope of political power & government.  Political authority may be limited constitutionally, by convention, or by competence.  Some authorities with absolute powers may control any aspect of their subject's lives while others may only regulate clearly demarcated aspects of society.  

A difference also exists between potential scope and actual scope owning to governmental competence.  Thus, the scope of a government's power to make laws may potentially be absolute owing to minimal constitutional constraints but only very limited in actuality owning to a lack of competent bureaucracy and civil service.

  - absolute vs limited
  - potential vs actual


### Concentration of power

More complex political authorities can be found in a variety of forms characterised by how concentrated power is in a single institution or entity.  Governments may be centralised in terms of jurisdiction or in terms of function

  - centralised vs decentralised
  - jurisdiction
    - central
    - federation
    - confederation
  - function
    - legislative
    - executive
    - judiciary


## Specific Democratic Dimensions

The general political dimensions can be applied all forms of political associations.  Democracy means rule of the people, thus all democracies are thus either polyarchies or panarchies.  And interesting consequence of this is that all democracies are republics by definition - states where supreme power is derived from the people.

Many modern states claim to be both constitutional monarchies and democracies - Australia, the UK, Denmark....  This however is a misnomer stemming from a conflation of terms.  Australia is a _crowned republic_. While having a monarch as nominal head of state, sovereignty resides in the people...

Yet despite the xxx requirement for democracies to be republics, this still doesn't prevent non-republics from being or acting democratically....


What follows now are dimensions specific to democracies...


### Distribution of power

How equally is power shared amongst the people.  Do the people shape laws and policy directly through specific actions or do they delegate this responsibility to others.

  - proximity
    - direct
    - delegative
    - representative
    - pluralist
  - suffrage
    - restricted
    - universal


### Transformitiveness

Does democracy transform the participants or is merely the aggregation of individual preferences or beliefs.

  - transformation vs aggregation


### Primacy of Freedom

What is the relation between freedoms and equality.  Differing conceptions of freedom and equality are incompatible.  Greater freedoms result in greater inequalities thanks to biological and historical inequalities.  Positive liberties come at the expense of negative ones.

Is freedom from external & arbitrary rule the primary focus of democratic justification or is freedom from internal oppression more important.  Are negative or positive freedoms given greater standing.  

Is equality given primacy over freedom or does freedom trump equality.  Is equality of ends more important that equality of opportunities.

Freedom

  - from external rule
  - from internal oppression
  - to realise own preferences

Equality

  - of ends
  - of opportunities
