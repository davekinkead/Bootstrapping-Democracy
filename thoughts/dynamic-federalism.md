# Dynamic Federalism

A solution to the Boundary Problem

Let's start with three foundational principals of political cooperation.  These are our bedrock values that must be accepted by everyone in our loose confederation.

  1. Reciprical Autonomy. I accept your right to self-determination on the condition that you accept the same right of others.

  2. Arbitration. We agree to be bound by some independent judgement in cases of externalities.

  3. Coherence.  Any lower order law must be compatible with a higher order one.

Look what's not here - there's no requirement to accept some pre-agreement authority, nor any other action guiding rules.

How it works...

  1. Any area or peoples may agree to the principles of confederation.

  2.  Any law passed with a simple majority is binding.

  3. Any group can claim autonomy on a law in their area.
