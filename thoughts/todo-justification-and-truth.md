In trying to justify one particular political theory, account, or conception of authority, a great deal hinges on what we mean by the terms we use.  So lets get clear about what we mean by things like `ideas`, `theories`, `beliefs`, and `truth`.  By ideas, we can mean both beliefs and theories.  `Equality is good` is both an idea and a belief.  `I have an idea about how to fix this problem` refers to a theory I have about the nature of the problem and a possible solution.  So the term `idea` can be used in reference to both theories and beliefs.

==What is belief?  A mental state, a disposition?==

It is also possible to have beliefs about theories.  `Liberal Democracy` is an idea and theory about a particular way society should be ordered and governed.  I can have beliefs about such theories - `Liberal Democracy is incoherent because liberalism is incompatible with democracy`, which then implies that I can have ideas about ideas.  I can also have beliefs about beliefs - `Believing that equality is good leads to perverse outcomes.`  In this sense we could say that the terms `idea` and `belief` are synonyms referencing to the same concept and can be used interchangeably.  Theories then can be thought of as more complex beliefs - sets or webs of beliefs that attempt to explain and predict phenomena in the external world.

Political beliefs, and therefore political theories, are beliefs relating to structure and governance of society. They have normative content - ie they are action guiding - and must be directed socially.  They are not just ideas about how the world works but rather ideas about how the world should be - who should rule, who should be ruled, and what principles should guide those rules?

So what role does truth play in the justification of political ideas?  In any analysis of the conditions that justify political beliefs, theories, and ideas, the role that truth plays in supporting them is of critical importance.

One way to examine this issue is to compare political belief with knowledge.  I seems unproblematic to claim that "I believe democracy to be the best form of government" whereas the the comparable claim "I know that democracy is the best form of government" seems both highly problematic and contentious.  

The difference between the two claims here hangs on the belief-knowledge distinction. Beliefs may turn out to be true or false, but knowledge seems to require beliefs to be true [^debate].  Again it is important to distinguish between related claims:

1. "Democracy is the best form of government"
2. "I believe democracy to be the best form of government"
3. "It is true that I believe democracy to be the best form of government".  

2 and 3 may be true while 1 is false.  1 may be true while 2 & 3 are false.  So while 2 & 3

Truth does not affect whether or not I can belief something, even though the truth of a claim should guide my believing.

[^debate]: There has been substantial debate since Gettier's refutation of knowledge as justified true belief.  Given that epistemology is not my field, I'll be steering clear of these for the time being.

Is it necessary?

Is it sufficient?

How do we know something to be true?

What are the broad theories of truth?

Can a belief or theory be justified without recourse to truth?

Knowledge implies belief but belief doesn't imply knowledge
